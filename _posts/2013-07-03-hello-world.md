Welcome to my Blog!

So I've finally decided to get myself a blog, after seeing a few options I decided to go with Jekyll and Github Pages.


## Purpose

I feel this blog could combine most of my passions, coding, movies, and anything else I feel like blogging about. To that end my goal is to separate the main page into multiple post groups. Each group would let you see new posts from that category.

As I add more topics I will update this post.


#### Coding

This would list any CS related topics, and though the title is "Coding" it would include algorithms and other such theoretical topics.


#### Media

This would be a conglomeration of any movies, books, and other such topics. Mostly this will compose of reviews.

#### Rant

Miscellaneous talks will go here


## Conclusion

{% assign level = "success" %}
{% assign no_icon = true %}
{% include alert_start %}
  <strong>Thank you</strong> for reading this far
{% include alert_end %}

Expect to see many changes for the next month (or a few more than that) as I customize this blog and personalize as much as I can.
