So I'm currently trying to install pygame for my mac, and man do I have tons of compilation problems. I'll list the solutions I found for every problem I have along the way.

## Setup

I used the following guide to install pygame, the 10.7 one which was the closest I could find.

## Problems

* `src/scale_mmx64.c:499:27: error: invalid instruction mnemonic 'movsxl'`
