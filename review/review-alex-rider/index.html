          <p>Alex Rider is a story about a kid learning the truth about his parent. Having been secretly trained as a spy from birth, he's coerced into working for the MI6 and always ends up saving the world from unknown catastrophy.</p>
<section class="&quot;section section2&quot;" id="review"><h2>Review</h2>
<p>It has been a while since I last read books from the Alex Rider series, but I can tell you they're worth re-reading.</p>
<p>The general plot follows Alex as he gets into difficult situations and uses his wits, training, and cool gadgets to escape hazards. He often not only triumphs, but comes out ahead, finding some new source of information which helps him uncover the final evil plan.</p>
<p>The series is quite easy to be immersed in, and nicely portrays the problems and challenges a spy might be facing. Some potential inaccuracy does exist, however it is outshadowed by the greater benefit it usually presents to the overall story. You can see that the author did his research, and consulted experts in quite a few fields when writing his books.</p>
<p>One of the main characteristics of this series is that Alex does not often wish to follow along with every Secret Service's requests for help. This is very realistic portrayal of the most likely reaction of a kid put in the situation he faces, and while I would prefer not to see him being coerced into these situations, it makes Alex seem much more normal and provides more believability to the story.</p>
<p>The evil villains of the Alex Rider universe do follow the standard James Bond procedure, but all seem to have unique quirks that make them much more. Not all of them would blab out their evil plan when Alex is caught and about to be killed, though most of them do end up leaving him to die.</p>
<p>Psychology plays a big part in the series, as we see Alex get hurt mentally with everything he goes through, and even though he seems to get back up a little too resiliently, it makes reading the books all the more accurate and enjoyable.</p>
