# Saevon's Blog

The `master` and `source` branches are different repositories.

This branch contains the (mostly) published code created from the `source` branch.

Almost none of the files here should be manually edited, except for the `README.md`. To see a list of the files that do get copied over (excepting the generated .html files) see `.publish-copy` on `master`.
