**Magic-Item:** A glove which stores up to 5 vials of substance, releasing them into your palm with a gesture.


### Summary

 * Hold up to 5 vials
 * Immediate Action to take one out (and maybe use it)
 * Takes up one **glove** slot.

### Storing

These gloves can hold up to **5 vials**, these can be any potions, oils, poisons, etc. Taking one of them out is a **immediate action**, putting one back in is a **movement action** that provokes an **AoO**.

Often these gloves don't come as pairs, but you can equip 2 of them to take up the full glove slot.

!alert! warning
    Using the item once its in your hand means following the applicable rules, drinking portions, throwing alchemy items, coating a weapon, etc. Thus they might still provoke AoO, or take time. However if the item takes a **Free**, **Immediate** or **Swift** Action, it can be folded into the act of activating the gloves.
!endalert!

You don't need to hold on to the item as it appears: dropping an item doesn't take an action. Thus you can have a vial of alchemists fire that you can drop at your feet as a immediate action (interrupt?)

A common use for these gloves is in conjunction with the [Teleportation Vial]({filename}teleport-vial.md) to teleport out of harms way.



### Legend

Though the story is but a small excerpt from a much larger tale, the highlights shall be retold here.

!alert! info
    **Craka**, **Galthor**, and **Aegis** were Player Characters in this scene. **Valkyrie**, and **Thrisperios** were still NPCs
!endalert!

**Craka** and **Aegis** had appeared in the middle of the Assasin's Guild, and while they had made a bit of a mess **Galthor** was still impressed with them. Deciding that they'd passed their trials, it was time for their first mission.

Their new team was fleshed out with **Galthor** and **Valkyrie** joining them, and their job was to find the 2nd Prince of the Land, **Thrisperios**.

    Timeskip! The [Chaos Party](/untold.html)<!-- ({filename}dice-chaos.md) --> happened during this timeskip.
!endalert!

Having followed **Silvia**'s directions, and having excavated a strange doorway, the party found that it was a portal to the Ethreal Plane. Travel in the Ethreal Plane is quite difficult, and the **Prince** was underground. So deciding to use the connection between the two planes, they dug a hole in the Material Plane, then used that passage in the Ethreal Plane to get to the **Prince**.

With **Aegis** going ahead as a Blink Dog, using dimension door to travel (**Aegis**: Which is quite ingenious), the rest of the group tried to remain hidden. Introducing himself to the **Prince**, **Aegis** was able to gain his friendship. However when **Craka** introduced himself as well, something caught the **Prince**'s suspicion.

With **Craka** not being trusted, he was forced to remain behind, following along with the other two assassin. Finding another set of Ruins, similar to the ones they found in the Crater, the **Prince** turned out to be capable of opening doors in this area. With **Aegis** secretly letting the rest of the party in, they continued trying to learn more about the **Prince**.

Meanwhile **Galthor**, being a rebel and all, decided this was his best chance to get rid of anyone who wanted to assassinate the **Prince**. Attacking **Valkyrie**, sealing as many of her abilities as possible, and nearly finishing her off in the initial strike. **Valkyrie** however wasn't a skilled assassin for nothing, always having an escape plan available! Activating her **Gloves of Storing**, and breaking the **Teleportation Vial**, she quickly escaped around corners, heading towards the **Prince**'s last known location.

Confusing **Craka**, **Galthor** convinced him that **Valkyrie** had betrayed them! Meanwhile **Valkyrie**, having found the **Prince**, used her grivious injuries to convince the **Prince** that she was a rebel. With **Craka** and **Aegis** able to communicate through **Silvia** they decided that they'd keep the two parties away from each other until they could figure out the truth.

!alert! info
    The rest of the tale will be posted sometime under "Zaii'Ren: The Chronicles of *Silvia*"
