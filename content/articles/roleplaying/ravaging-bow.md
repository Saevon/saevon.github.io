**Magical Item:** An incomplete bow that multiplies every arrow it shoots. In its current broken state, it shoots 2 arrows aimed properly, and one that aims towards the user.
Don't underestimate its power! Though it targets the user as well, the bow can behead its opponents with ease, and enchants its arrows with any spell cast on it.


### Summary

 * +3 Composite Longbow (1d8 Piercing, 125ft range, Vorpal)
    * +4 Maximum Str bonus
 * Spell Storing 3
 * **Arrow Storm**: Shoots 3 arrows, cloning the arrow type you use
 * **Broken Item**: Shoots an arrow at yourself, and 2 at the enemy (roll 2d20)


### Arrow Storm

This bow fires three arrows, any spell that the bow has stored is applied to the arrow, and the +3 enchantment bonus (if better than the arrow) is as well. But see the **Broken Item** section below. Though the bow can be given to players as a complete, unbroken version.

!alert! warning
    **Optional**: The bow can technically be used to fire at someone with arrow catching, which wouldn't waste the arrow. If this happens, the DM can allow more spells to be added to the arrow each time its fired. Though this obviously can lead to abuse. As long as your players use it for crazy hijinks, this can be a great addition

#### Flavour Text

This ability spawns the two additional arrows beside the original as it leaves the bow.

### Broken Item

The Ravaging Bow is made to seek out enemies, attempting to behead them if possible. However when it clones one of the arrows in the wrong position (aimed towards the user). Thus when attacking roll 2d20, one for the arrow flying towards you, and one for the arrows flying towards the enemy.

!alert! success
    You can have someone standing by with gloves of arrow catching to prevent any problems with arrows flying towards you. Remember to let the players figure out these things themselves.

### Legend

Though the story is but a small excerpt from a much larger tale, the highlights shall be retold here.

!alert! info
    All of **Craka**, **Valkyrie**, **Sai**, **Galthor**, and **Aegis** were Player Characters in this schene
!endalert!

**Craka**: a barbarian wielding an artifact of power (*Silvia*), **Valkyrie**: an arcane archer wielding the **Ravaging Bow** and the rest of the party enter a dragon's layer.

Fighting the dragon (**Sai**) high above a perilous drop, on a huge overhang, with a glorious battle and wounds all around, the party was pushed back, and with **Valkyrie** near death, **Sai** throws her off the overhang! With **Sai** following after her, under the overhang to avoid damage from the members above. **Craka**, thinking fast jumps down after them.

Activiting Backlash Drain (syncing all damage and healing between him and **Sai**, and doing extra damage to both of them). **Valkyrie** takes one last shot, hoping to defeat **Sai** before he finishes her off, and rolls... 2 natural 20's! (after confirming the crit) With **Craka**'s and **Sai**'s health being synced together, a triple beheading occurs as the three of them crash into the ground below.

!alert! success
    While the rest of the party was not mentioned, that in no way implies their lack of awesomeness, just that they weren't really part of the beheaded trio (In this case **Galthor**, **Aegis**, and **Thrisperios** (An NPC which the **Craka**'s Player took over)

!alert! info
    The rest of the tale will be posted sometime under "Zai'Ren: The Chronicles of *Silvia*"
