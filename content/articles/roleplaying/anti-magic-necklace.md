**Magical Item:** A Necklace that allows you to Create an aura of Anti-Magic around you.
Perfect for those pesky wizards! And great against creatures which eat magic as well, (as all magic is suppressed for a short period of time)


### Summary

  * 1/day
  * 1d4+1 rnds of Anti-Magic
  * 10ft radius sphere
  * Takes up the **Neck** slot.

### Anti-Magic

This acts like the spell **Antimagic Field** and cannot be cast unless worn.


### Anti-Kaern

This necklace was made to fight against the Kaern, which eat magic, and spread a magical disease while doing so. Thus while allied abilities are suppressed under the field, no magic eating can occur.
