**Magical Item:** A pair of dice in an engraved wooden dice cup. Upon being rolled they summon random, weird creatures (unallied).


### Usage

 * Duration: ??

When the dice leave the cup, and land on a surface, they turn black and summon a creature based on what was rolled. While they are black the dice are **immovable** like the *Immovable Rod*. When the creature dies or the spell runs out they reappear in the dice cup.

Regardless of how you roll the dice, the faces don't actually correspond to the result. The die faces will change to fit the rolled result. This means one cannot rig the dice no matter how hard they try.

You can take the dice out of the cup, and they can be put down normally, however the second they get *rolled* or *dropped* they will activate.
