This is the person tasked with drawing an image of the fauna and flora of the world they encounter, focusing primarily on the monsters. Whereas the Journal Keeper writes upon their experiences this person captures the imagery of what they encounter and hopefully get it published in the legendary Dragonica.

This is a role which doesn't require a superb artist to fill, all that would be required is just a fun individual who is willingly to draw up their concept of the monsters for the other members to see.
