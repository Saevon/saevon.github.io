&lt;li&gt;Take up a &lt;strong&gt;ring&lt;/strong&gt; slot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show the direction (3D) and distance of the partner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show the Health and Status of the partner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Often a Ring of Protection +1 to +5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="legend"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Legend&lt;/h3&gt;

All of &lt;strong&gt;Craka&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Sai&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Galthor&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Aegis&lt;/strong&gt; were Player Characters in this scene
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A set of rings were found on the epic looking dead elf in the control room for the Museum Level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="alert alert-info "&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-info-circle"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
The rest of the tale will be posted sometime under "Zaii'Ren: The Chronicles of &lt;em&gt;Silvia&lt;/em&gt;"

&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="summary"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold up to 5 vials&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Immediate Action to take one out (and maybe use it)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Takes up one &lt;strong&gt;glove&lt;/strong&gt; slot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="storing"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Storing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These gloves can hold up to &lt;strong&gt;5 vials&lt;/strong&gt;, these can be any potions, oils, poisons, etc. Taking one of them out is a &lt;strong&gt;immediate action&lt;/strong&gt;, putting one back in is a &lt;strong&gt;movement action&lt;/strong&gt; that provokes an &lt;strong&gt;AoO&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often these gloves don't come as pairs, but you can equip 2 of them to take up the full glove slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="alert alert-warning "&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-warning"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
Using the item once its in your hand means following the applicable rules, drinking portions, throwing alchemy items, coating a weapon, etc. Thus they might still provoke AoO, or take time. However if the item takes a &lt;strong&gt;Free&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Immediate&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Swift&lt;/strong&gt; Action, it can be folded into the act of activating the gloves.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don't need to hold on to the item as it appears: dropping an item doesn't take an action. Thus you can have a vial of alchemists fire that you can drop at your feet as a immediate action (interrupt?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common use for these gloves is in conjunction with the &lt;a href="//blog.saevon.ca/roleplaying/teleportation-vial/"&gt;Teleportation Vial&lt;/a&gt; to teleport out of harms way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="legend"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Legend&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the story is but a small excerpt from a much larger tale, the highlights shall be retold here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="alert alert-info "&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-info-circle"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Craka&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Galthor&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Aegis&lt;/strong&gt; were Player Characters in this scene. &lt;strong&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Thrisperios&lt;/strong&gt; were still NPCs
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Craka&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Aegis&lt;/strong&gt; had appeared in the middle of the Assasin's Guild, and while they had made a bit of a mess &lt;strong&gt;Galthor&lt;/strong&gt; was still impressed with them. Deciding that they'd passed their trials, it was time for their first mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their new team was fleshed out with &lt;strong&gt;Galthor&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/strong&gt; joining them, and their job was to find the 2nd Prince of the Land, &lt;strong&gt;Thrisperios&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="alert alert-info "&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-info-circle"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
Timeskip! The &lt;a href="{filename}dice-chaos.md"&gt;Chaos Party&lt;/a&gt; happened during this timeskip.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having followed &lt;strong&gt;Silvia&lt;/strong&gt;'s directions, and having excavated a strange doorway, the party found that it was a portal to the Ethreal Plane. Travel in the Ethreal Plane is quite difficult, and the &lt;strong&gt;Prince&lt;/strong&gt; was underground. So deciding to use the connection between the two planes, they dug a hole in the Material Plane, then used that passage in the Ethreal Plane to get to the &lt;strong&gt;Prince&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;strong&gt;Aegis&lt;/strong&gt; going ahead as a Blink Dog, using dimension door to travel (&lt;strong&gt;Aegis&lt;/strong&gt;: Which is quite ingenious), the rest of the group tried to remain hidden. Introducing himself to the &lt;strong&gt;Prince&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Aegis&lt;/strong&gt; was able to gain his friendship. However when &lt;strong&gt;Craka&lt;/strong&gt; introduced himself as well, something caught the &lt;strong&gt;Prince&lt;/strong&gt;'s suspicion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;strong&gt;Craka&lt;/strong&gt; not being trusted, he was forced to remain behind, following along with the other two assassin. Finding another set of Ruins, similar to the ones they found in the Crater, the &lt;strong&gt;Prince&lt;/strong&gt; turned out to be capable of opening doors in this area. With &lt;strong&gt;Aegis&lt;/strong&gt; secretly letting the rest of the party in, they continued trying to learn more about the &lt;strong&gt;Prince&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile &lt;strong&gt;Galthor&lt;/strong&gt;, being a rebel and all, decided this was his best chance to get rid of anyone who wanted to assassinate the &lt;strong&gt;Prince&lt;/strong&gt;. Attacking &lt;strong&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/strong&gt;, sealing as many of her abilities as possible, and nearly finishing her off in the initial strike. &lt;strong&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/strong&gt; however wasn't a skilled assassin for nothing, always having an escape plan available! Activating her &lt;strong&gt;Gloves of Storing&lt;/strong&gt;, and breaking the &lt;strong&gt;Teleportation Vial&lt;/strong&gt;, she quickly escaped around corners, heading towards the &lt;strong&gt;Prince&lt;/strong&gt;'s last known location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confusing &lt;strong&gt;Craka&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Galthor&lt;/strong&gt; convinced him that &lt;strong&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/strong&gt; had betrayed them! Meanwhile &lt;strong&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/strong&gt;, having found the &lt;strong&gt;Prince&lt;/strong&gt;, used her grivious injuries to convince the &lt;strong&gt;Prince&lt;/strong&gt; that she was a rebel. With &lt;strong&gt;Craka&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Aegis&lt;/strong&gt; able to communicate through &lt;strong&gt;Silvia&lt;/strong&gt; they decided that they'd keep the two parties away from each other until they could figure out the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="alert alert-info "&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-info-circle"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
The rest of the tale will be posted sometime under "Zaii'Ren: The Chronicles of &lt;em&gt;Silvia&lt;/em&gt;"

&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="summary"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free Action to crush one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dimension Door: &lt;em&gt;Conjuration (Teleportation)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aura&lt;/strong&gt;: Moderate Conjuration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="dimension-door"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Dimension Door&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you crush one of these vials, you teleport in the indicated direction (where you're pointing, any distance) as if by &lt;strong&gt;Dimension Door&lt;/strong&gt;. You can't use the "visualizing the location method", but you can teleport into an unknown location. You also cannot bring another creature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common use for these vials is in conjunction with the &lt;a href="//blog.saevon.ca/roleplaying/glove-of-storing/"&gt;Storing Gloves&lt;/a&gt; to teleport out of harms way. The gloves drop a vial into your hand as an immediate action, and then you can crush one as part of that action, thus using it as an easy escape out of danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="alert alert-warning "&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-warning"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
Remember &lt;strong&gt;Dimension Door&lt;/strong&gt; ends your turn.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Many new passages and possibilities were found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section2&amp;quot;" id="cast"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cast&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zantar&lt;/strong&gt; (Human? Mage): Sorceror&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jack&lt;/strong&gt; (Half-Nymph Hunter): Archer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Played by &lt;strong&gt;Cr4ka&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moonshai, Disciple of the Great Dracolich&lt;/strong&gt; (Kobold Warlock):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section2&amp;quot;" id="story"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Underneath a dense canopy of vines and brush the small band of souls and perhaps lost souls venture forth. Hoping to find some sort of answer to explain any of the strange occurrences that have befallen them and the world above. In a faint call, almost a whisper yet surprisingly clear,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There is a clearing up ahead, you gotta come see this" informed Zaire the Invisible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Now what?" responded Moonshai in an annoyed tone while looking sideways at weasel twice his size. Thinking to himself, "How did I, the worshipper of the Great Dracolich, the future Tribe Leader of Small-kin, end up babysitting this thing?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dire weasel just licked his face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little up ahead the locally proclaimed "vampire" Nymph was swinging his naginata in a vigorous and masterful manner slicing off vines that got in the way. Although being one with nature generally meant not destroying a plant simply because it was in the way, but there was something odd about these vines, something that just didn't sit right with Jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right behind him a figure with a majestic hawk perched on his shoulder, Zantar "the undead", was double checking his magical components. Pouch with various mineral dusts, check. Small animal bones and feathers, check. Then a small sigh of pride escaped his mouth as he patted a small pouch on his belt. His newest addition, the perfect blend of sulfur and grade A quality bat guano. Check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oblivious to the upcoming clearing, a hunched figure stumbled close behind Zantar. Artix's attention focused on some piece of mechanism in his hands. Out of his mouth came a spur of whispering noises which generally sound like a bunch of hissing. But to any nearby time travellers that could slow down time about 10 fold, they would hear some odd cursing, something to do with too many elbows getting in the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the trail opened up a great pink crystal towered above the treetops all the way up to the ceiling of the cavern. Trapped inside the pink, the skeletal remains of a draconic creature of old. Around the crystal a skeletal centipede spiralled almost as if constricting the whole structure. Around, were a series of ring indents and on each ring atop a stone base stood a statue depicting a combat stance centered on the crystal itself. These statues portrayed a hardy barbarian, a heroic fighter, and a cunning wizard, all but the barbarian with their weapons clearly missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some 50 ft above two huge gouts of water were hitting the crystal as if two colossal sized giants were having a pissing contest, but neither was willing to give up. By an unknown magic the water seemed to dissipate into nothingness upon impact. This motion intrigued the local artificer with a slight fear of water who at this point began constructing a 51 ft poking stick. At the same time Zaire and Zantar began investigating the statues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The base of each statue contains a notch that perfectly fits inside the circular grooves," reasoned Zaire "Then perhaps it may be possible to move these statues along the grooves."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a short struggle as they attempted to push the fighter statue along the groove, but it was quickly determined that the statues are far too heavy, as if they were made from an extremely dense material such as stone. With physical efforts leading nowhere Zantar's greed took over. Knowing that statues in this particular temple/cavern/dungeon are prone to have secret compartments with goodies, he began casting a spell to detect secret treasures. Coincidentally Zantar just recently began to master the deviously hilarious language of draconic and decided to use it to cast his spell. Well due to his noviceness in the draconic tongue he mispronounced the phrase "secret treasure" and instead ended up saying "secret passage" thus resulting in a different magical effect. Due to this minor alteration he located some secret tunnels up in the dense tree canopy surrounding the clearing. Everyone flashed back to a previous ambush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Tatzlwyrm," they all spoke in unison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general consensus was to stay clear of the secret tunnels. Except for Jack who decided, that despite the likelihood of the results, someone must investigate the tunnels and began scaling a tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After an anticlimactic experience with the statues Zaire turned his attention to the giant pink rock. After circling it a few times and looking for some proper foot holds he decided to run up the vertical wall of the crystal. Perhaps if anyone could actually see Zaire then he may have been slightly embarrassed at that moment, because it was the first time in his life that he could not run up a vertical wall. This was due to some odd repulsion field that pushed back when he approached the center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually Artix completed his 51ft pole and maneuvered it into one of the gouts of water. The momentum of the flying water caught the edge of the pole and pulled it violently towards the crystal, causing the pole to explode into a shower of damp splinters. Which in some oriental lands is known to be a pleasant acupuncture technique when the correct types of wood are used, this was not that case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack's luck ran out when he fell out of the tree with the secret tunnels and barely managed to not break his face, but fate is a bitch and some things are just meant to happen, just not yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As ingenuity dwindled Zantar decided that a more spiritual approach was in order and began an interpretive dance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What are you doing?" asked Artix as he watched Zantar make a fool of himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I am performing a spiritual dance to entice whatever memories out of the crystal and into my audience," Zantar responded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Hmmm, and then what?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Well that's easy, we snatch 'em and figure out what the deal is with this here crystal."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still unsure with the validity of the plan Artix decided to begin some vague religious spirit summoning chant. Partially hoping to help this plan along, but mostly to make this look like a proper ritual incase anyone else was looking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magic works in weird ways and this time it decided to convince Artix that not holding things with hands was totally normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'm still not seeing any memories, perhaps some psychedelic herbs could help&amp;hellip;" implied Zantar, while dancing like a crown bearer carrying a 400lb elaborate headpiece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing absolutely no downside to this suggestion and a huge stockpile of herbs Artix begins to search through the herbs with his feet. Any other herbalist would cringe at the sight of a delicate shadow rose, whose market value could purchase a small town, being crushed between the dirty toes of a gnome. Nevertheless an Illusioner's cap was located and ingested by the sole dancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Zaire and Jack decided that being injured and having no powers was unacceptable they decided to rest. Consequently the interpreted dance was delayed until more psychedelic conditions present themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"How are my pupils?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; "Normal"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having nothing to do the group backtracked to a safer location near the crying statue fountain. Keen to show his acrobatic abilities, Zaire tumbled into a tight spot in the fountain causing a clicking noise upon landing on the floor. He then proceeded to fall asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"How are my pupils?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Normal," doubted Artix, and having realized that holding with hands was a good idea, decided to double check the drugs eaten by Zantar. It was not an Illusioner's cap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then a strange fog befell the area. Ideas of compressed corn and bacteria processed milk clouded the minds of past. When the fog settled&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mechanical valve protruded out of the fountain where Zaire had slept. It was rotated sunwise and counter-sunwize but the result was the same, nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rude valve which refused to do anything regardless of how much attention it was getting, ended up getting the silent treatment. Upon realizing that Jack was no longer in the vicinity of fountain area the remaining humanoid creatures and weasel continued down a newly found dried creek with a conveniently naginata cut tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere down the path a nymph was furiously hacking at a wall of vines that dared not move aside when asked nicely. Due to some temporal discrepancies but more likely due to Zaire's ability to run really quickly as compared to everyone else, a ninja and a nymph stood before an opening covered with a whole lot of vines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Send in the clones!" demanded Jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"No"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Cmon just do it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"No"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Well then hold me up while I check this out."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Fine," conceded Zaire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Fate stopped being lazy and finally caught up to Jack, or perhaps this was a way for the vines to get revenge for their fallen comrades. Regardless because as Jack pulled apart some vines a small &lt;em&gt;blupe&lt;/em&gt; of lava splashed on his right cheek. On the plus side he no longer needs to open his mouth in order to breath through it. No further inquiries into the opening where made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all know that magic is strange and since this place is full of it perhaps that is why Moonshai decided to speak as if he had an opinion to say. He also developed a sense of empathy upon seeing Jack's horrendous hole in the side of his face. After some careful consideration,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Well he did give one of my most trusted friends a proper burial," Moonshai decided that Jack was indeed worthy of one charge of the wand of cure moderate wounds. Perhaps this is the start of a beautiful friendship, but it is definitely the start of a lot of mooching off Moonshai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The party realized that the creek from the fountain leads to the crystal and the grooved rings. This meant that perhaps turning on the fountain could in some way benefit them and cause unexpected results. Having absolutely no idea how mechanisms work in this fortification, they decided that the pump-like machines a few hundred feet below the fountain must be related.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Determined to get the only friendly "mechanic" to the pumps, Moonshai began to experiment with his carrying capabilities while flying. He was lifting some gnome sized rocks before realizing that gnomes are stubborn and they prefer not to get burned by lava elementals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead the humanoids and weasel scaled down to the main river and embarked on a raft ride to the laboratory on the opposite side of the fortification. Along the northern section of the river, Artix recognized the location of his first brief encounter with the Urthak. It was a wide rock hill with a waterfall crashing at the top. This was the same water that flowed through the kobold temple near the surface and contained strange mind altering abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the journey was short and was only delayed by an opening in the lava treatment section of the fort. Barely avoiding a party split, the group arrived before the windows to the laboratory. Where a ninja clone attempted to jump through the glass, but instead bounced off it with a satisfying thump and a small bump on his head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to problems along the highway, Groll was left behind to "&lt;em&gt;clean up&lt;/em&gt;", with the rest of the band moving on to the village. The four of them arrived, and were assured the mithril would be brought in by the next day, as promised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="excerpt-from-x"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Excerpt from X&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[DM: Excerpt from the journal of X]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our four brave heroes have settled at an in waiting for our shipment of mithril to be prepared. The Great Emperor, the Red Dragon will be pleased with the offering. Thinking so, our heroes let their guards down and retire for the night when&amp;hellip; BOOM~~~! Everything exploded. There were fires everywhere. Our heroes work hard to gather and make it to the mayor to find the THE MITHRIL HAD BEEN STOLEN ) O o O (. What will they do now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furious (not really) they charged off towards the mines. Moving through various traps, almost dieing to various shades of pink liquids, and defeating various sizes of goblins. Finally they made it to the EEEE~VIL necromancer and beat the crap out of him too. Thus saving the day and putting an end to the disease plaguing the citizens (which we failed to mention). The heroes march off with their rewards?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="excerpt-from-daniels"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Excerpt from Daniels&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woke up in a caved-in, burning inn. X got caught under a collapsed roof. Everyone eventually awoke and got out by climbing the rubble remains of the side of the inn. Met the mayor, he believes the goblins must have attacked the humans when they found out that humans have been mining mithil out of their caves (also ancient dwarven ruins). Party went to check out the mithril they were supposed to give as tribute but it was gone via implosion teleport magic. Mayor then begged the party to figure out the cause of the plague going around in the town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the mines the party took forever to enter the corridor due to arrow slits in the walls. Nothing happened. Inside the party tripped the noise trap in one room and opened a flooded room which was full of pinkish water. Which “seemed” to be just like normal water. Party managed to close the flooded room doors before much damage was done. Down the stairs the party found a submerged room with a magic hammer and some ruby eyed statues. X sunk down to the room using the full plate and then was brought back with a rope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next corridor was booby trapped with barrels full of shit. Some kobolds got hit, and the magic hammer was also covered by this substance. In the next room the party decimated a small army of hobgoblins and blew up an ogre, and to top it all off: flooded the room. Eventually the party reached the main caverns where they caught up with Groll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the hobgoblins from the previous room had his brains eaten and as a result was essentially a vegetable. The party used his remains to test a slightly more Pinkish fluid that pooled up at the end of the caverns. The mining caverns proved to be nearly fatal for Groll when he decided to go swimming in the pink liquid. The party found piles of dead hobgoblins and eventually found a room with huge columns of liquid mithral. On the bottom of this room there were swarms of fire ants which were quickly taken out by the molten mithral. The next room was a trap room with golden walls and false floors everywhere but the middle. This was a simple endeavor for all but X who nearly fell off right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final room contained an Orc cleric with seemed to control a blob of floating purple water. Which was later determined to be the source of the contaminated water in the nearby town. The Orc almost succeeded a party wipe, but was quickly dispatched due to his own sickness. The party found an empty crypt with a missing necklace in the middle of the room. Which was believed to belong to the former resident lich.&lt;/p&gt;

With the threat beginning to reveal itself, the party does its best just to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section2&amp;quot;" id="cast"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cast&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section2&amp;quot;" id="story"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Gnomes of Aiventrix&lt;/strong&gt; are a peaceful race of inventors, a protectorate under &lt;strong&gt;Baron Ashon&lt;/strong&gt;. The gnomes refuse to craft anything for combat, and it is illegal to ever do so for any gnome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our story begins with &lt;strong&gt;Artix the Uncanny&lt;/strong&gt;, an inventor who got caught making his "Flaming Warhammer", yet another attempt to create easily reproducible magic items. With &lt;strong&gt;Artix&lt;/strong&gt; in prison, and forced to face other gnomes in their gladiatorial arena, he plots his escape. The &lt;strong&gt;Baron&lt;/strong&gt; saw this opportunity and sent &lt;strong&gt;Zaire&lt;/strong&gt;, who is being groomed to take over as resident spymaster, to get him out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Artix&lt;/strong&gt; prepared his escape carefully, hiding extra gear all around his laboratory as best he could. Barely keeping up against the other gnomish crafters who would make sure he had no way to escape, or gear secreted away. Though starting to give up hope, the message from the &lt;strong&gt;Baron&lt;/strong&gt; gave him hope, and a plan was laid out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet another battle &lt;strong&gt;Artix&lt;/strong&gt; fought, defeating his opponent in the arena once more. Yet with new protective measures (a taser) being snuck into his gear, he was caught of guard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zaire&lt;/strong&gt; snuck in, careful to leave an escape route for the two of them, but with &lt;strong&gt;Artix&lt;/strong&gt; still being dragged out of the arena, the time window was getting smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[DM: The rest is an excerpt from the journal of &lt;strong&gt;Jack&lt;/strong&gt;, with some notes added for clarity&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the unconscious gnome was dragged shamefully to his dirty urine covered cell, &lt;strong&gt;Zaire&lt;/strong&gt; picked the lock and dragged his unresponsive burden towards the exit he had previously mapped out. Noticing his useless companion is naked &lt;em&gt;[DM: not actually]&lt;/em&gt; and unequipped &lt;strong&gt;Zaire&lt;/strong&gt; decided to bring the gnome to a nearby workroom and dumped him face first into what looked like a bucket but could just as well been a bedpan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally awake &lt;strong&gt;Artix&lt;/strong&gt; quickly gathered up some equipment he thought was useful and the two of them headed towards the exit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon reaching the guard room, they noticed they had missed the guard change due to one of their tardiness and now faced with two armed gnomish guards. They rushed in and were able to subdue the guards but in the process &lt;strong&gt;Zaire&lt;/strong&gt; was shocked to unconsciousness by the protective armor the gnome guard was wearing. In a panic &lt;strong&gt;Artix&lt;/strong&gt; rushed out the prison dragging his companion only to find himself cut off by a cliff. Realizing he could not scale the cliff carrying such a heavy load, he decided to tell his friend to lose some weight in the future and also to search for some mean of waking him up. Luckily he found some potions of light heal in the pockets of the guards he defeated (among other things) and was able to revive his friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two of them quickly climbed down the cliff and meet up with &lt;strong&gt;Zaire’s&lt;/strong&gt; hireling. With the help of his hirelings the two quickly made it to an abandoned hideout &lt;strong&gt;Zaire&lt;/strong&gt; previously prepared [After a long boat ride to the local coast the group needed to lay low for three days before the gnomish searchers would widen their net, allowing them to slip by through the mountain pass].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However their movements were noticed by a local “human” hunter by the name of &lt;strong&gt;Jack&lt;/strong&gt;, who followed them into the cave out of “curiosity”. Upon entering the cave, the two noticed that the walls of the cave were splattered with blood, and they found bed rolls with dead bodies (with their hands chopped off) scattered near a dying fire. [Another body was lying in the middle of writing a dying message in a small alcove]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spying on the two, &lt;strong&gt;Jack&lt;/strong&gt; ventured into the cave as well, unknowingly he was attacked by a sneaky zombie that no one else in the world could have ever noticed. Fully calm and not panicking at all, he fired an arrow which hit the zombie square in the head and knocking it away. However this action revealed him to the two already scared shitless in the cave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They exchanged greetings and decided to figure out what is going on together. Being the bravest out of the three, &lt;strong&gt;Jack&lt;/strong&gt; decided to check the body in the bed roll. He was able to find a large sum of gold which he pocketed without the SLIGHTEST SUSPICION OR NOTICE FROM THE OTHER TWO &lt;em&gt;[DM: he was totally noticed]&lt;/em&gt;. [With &lt;strong&gt;Artix&lt;/strong&gt; noticing that the body was wearing typical necromancer gear, a follower of Nerghul]. &lt;strong&gt;Zaire&lt;/strong&gt; uncovered a dagger from one of the bodies lying on the wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a bit of searching, the three noticed a looming shadow from the way they came. A large spider like creature was feeding on the zombie &lt;strong&gt;Jack&lt;/strong&gt; had previously slain. With much valor &lt;strong&gt;Jack&lt;/strong&gt; let loose an arrow towards the monster, but the creature was nimble and possibly with the aid of some black magic was able to avoid the otherwise unavoidable arrow. Now enraged, the creature charged towards the party, but was slowed down by the narrowness of the cave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The party quickly got on their feet and started to sprint the other way. &lt;strong&gt;Zaire&lt;/strong&gt; was able to dive into a nearby cave river and hid underwater (but there was zombies in the water so he couldn’t stay long) &lt;em&gt;[DM: an enclosure with a set of chain fences holding the zombies at bay, so they could be reused by the necromancer]&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Jack&lt;/strong&gt; the fastest of the three got away safely, while the misshapen gnome was not so fortunate, the creature made short work of his feeble prey and trapped him with spiderweb. The (yet again) unconscious gnome was dragged and dumped into a pile of dead bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other two were able to hide from the monster, after a while they circled back and looked to regroup. &lt;strong&gt;Zaire&lt;/strong&gt; noticed that &lt;strong&gt;Artix’s&lt;/strong&gt; bag was lost to the rushing water of the river and could not be retrieved &lt;em&gt;[DM: he means the party didn't want to risk it]&lt;/em&gt;. After a bit of searching the three had regrouped and freed the almost crippled gnome from his bondage. The three then made a distraction and rushed out of the cave with a secret exit which &lt;strong&gt;Zaire&lt;/strong&gt; had prior knowledge to. Finally safe the three found themselves in a storage room. [&lt;strong&gt;Artix&lt;/strong&gt; pried open a barrel revealing a set of scrolls, which &lt;strong&gt;Zaire&lt;/strong&gt; packed away with him]. Stocked up on all the necessary supplies, the party got on a boat and headed down the river.&lt;/p&gt;

Its main purpose is to absorb all magic, refusing to be sheathed if its purpose isn't met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="summary"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;+3 flutter blade (1Handed, 1d4+1d6 piercing or slashing, 19-20 Crit)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move action to switch between slashing and piercing damage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Symbols on it pulse with a faint sky blue light (rad 10' bright, rad 15' shadowy)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Merciful&lt;/strong&gt;: Only does subdual damage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mage Killer&lt;/strong&gt;: On successful hit can steal magic (see below)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;+6 vs Magic items or effects (see below)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cursed Item&lt;/strong&gt;: You can't sheathe the blade without draining magic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="mage-killer"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Mage Killer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every successful hit with this blade steals magic, choose one of the following for the blade to eat:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Up 6 spell levels worth of spells/day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Up to 2 uses of a &lt;strong&gt;Su&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Sp&lt;/strong&gt; ability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One infinite use &lt;strong&gt;Su&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Sp&lt;/strong&gt; ability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any spell affect currently on the user&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any effects of a magical item, disabling it for 1 hour&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a magical item provides multiple bonuses, only one is disabled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;e.g. +2 Keen Flaming Weapon: Only one of those 3 effects can be stolen per attack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that any ability that is the equivalent of a &lt;strong&gt;7th&lt;/strong&gt; level spell or higher cannot be stolen. Also Kaern's Blade cannot affect artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a &lt;strong&gt;Confirmed Critical&lt;/strong&gt; instead of doing bonus damage, the user can steal the magic instead, being able to store it in the blade for up to &lt;strong&gt;1 Hour&lt;/strong&gt;. The user can then cast/use as if he is the original source of the magic. If the original source is destroyed, the magic is lost as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The owner can specifically choose to target an effect or magical item, treat this as a &lt;strong&gt;called shot&lt;/strong&gt;, but with a &lt;strong&gt;+6 Echantment&lt;/strong&gt; bonus. However when using this the weapon does no damage at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="alert alert-info "&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-info-circle"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Optional&lt;/strong&gt;: You can even have the blade be able to absorb magic being cast on it. If the user readies a standard action to defend himself from magic, they can make an attack roll against the opponents caster level check.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="merciful"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Merciful&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blade refuses to kill any living being, specifically any creature termed alive, intelligent or soulled, doing only subdual damage to these creatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When this blade deals damage treat it as normal for the purposes of &lt;strong&gt;Damage Resistance&lt;/strong&gt;. Then apply all damage as &lt;strong&gt;subdual damage&lt;/strong&gt; to the creature. The blade cannot take a creature below &lt;strong&gt;-5 HP&lt;/strong&gt;, refusing to damage said creatures. It can still steal magic from them however. Note that some creatures are soulled, but can't go below &lt;strong&gt;0 HP&lt;/strong&gt; in which case they are brought to at most &lt;strong&gt;1 HP&lt;/strong&gt;, and any further damage from Kaern's Blade causes them to be &lt;strong&gt;Disabled&lt;/strong&gt;: unable to do any mental or physical actions until &lt;strong&gt;8 hours* or they have &lt;/strong&gt;1 HP** worth of healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ability is also affected by the owner's thoughts. Thus if an animated item was seen as a "pet" by the owner, the blade would refuse to destroy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section4&amp;quot;" id="flavour-text"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Flavour Text&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ability manifests as the blade passing through opponents, and causing them to feel more and more exhausted, or . Thus the blade is still used to slash or stab, but passes through the opponents instead, seemingly turning into a pale blue ghostly blade. Against creatures immune to subdual damage, it works like normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally named after Lord Kaern, who also created the original "Kaern" (magitech items)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="description"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaern's Blade is a True Chaotic intelligent magic item, it does not speak, or act in any way by itself, lying dormant most of the time. The blade's refusal to kill and Magic absorption are a facet of its personality, as it was originally made to destroy wards and other magical defenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blade is a pale silver colour, with glowing sky blue symbols along the length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Saevon</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 11 Oct 2015 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag://blog.saevon.ca,2015-10-11:roleplaying/kaerns-blade/</guid><category>magic-item</category><category>D&amp;D</category></item><item><title>Necklace of Anti-Magic</title><link>//blog.saevon.ca/roleplaying/necklace-of-anti-magic/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magical Item:&lt;/strong&gt; A Necklace that allows you to Create an aura of Anti-Magic around you.
Perfect for those pesky wizards! And great against creatures which eat magic as well, (as all magic is suppressed for a short period of time)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="summary"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1d4+1 rnds of Anti-Magic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10ft radius sphere&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Takes up the &lt;strong&gt;Neck&lt;/strong&gt; slot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="anti-magic"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Anti-Magic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This acts like the spell &lt;strong&gt;Antimagic Field&lt;/strong&gt; and cannot be cast unless worn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="anti-kaernor"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Anti-Kaernor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This necklace was made to fight against the Kaernor, which eat magic, and spread a magical disease while doing so. Thus while allied abilities are suppressed under the field, no magic eating can occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Saevon</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 11 Oct 2015 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag://blog.saevon.ca,2015-10-11:roleplaying/necklace-of-anti-magic/</guid><category>magic-item</category><category>D&amp;D</category></item><item><title>Vampiric Blade</title><link>//blog.saevon.ca/roleplaying/vampiric-blade/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magical Item:&lt;/strong&gt; A bloodthirsty sword that always draws blood, any wielder is filled with a slight bloodlust, and is unable to sheathe it without drawing blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="summary"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;+3 elven thinblade (1Handed, 1d8 piercing, 18-20x2 Crit)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Symbols on it pulse with a faint blood red light (rad 10' bright, rad 15' shadowy)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vampiric&lt;/strong&gt;: 1d4 Con Damage on hit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cursed Item&lt;/strong&gt;: You can't sheathe the blade without it drinking blood&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="description"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vampiric blade is made of adamantine (dark red color with a thin silvery hue), with glowing red symbols along the length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Saevon</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 10 Oct 2015 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag://blog.saevon.ca,2015-10-10:roleplaying/vampiric-blade/</guid><category>magic-item</category><category>D&amp;D</category></item><item><title>Ravaging Bow</title><link>//blog.saevon.ca/roleplaying/ravaging-bow/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magical Item:&lt;/strong&gt; An incomplete bow that multiplies every arrow it shoots. In its current broken state, it shoots 2 arrows aimed properly, and one that aims towards the user.
Don't underestimate its power! Though it targets the user as well, the bow can behead its opponents with ease, and enchants its arrows with any spell cast on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="summary"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;+3 Composite Longbow (1d8 Piercing, 125ft range, Vorpal)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;+4 Maximum Str bonus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spell Storing 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arrow Storm&lt;/strong&gt;: Shoots 3 arrows, cloning the arrow type you use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broken Item&lt;/strong&gt;: Shoots an arrow at yourself, and 2 at the enemy (roll 2d20)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aura&lt;/strong&gt;: Overwhelming Transmutation and Necromancy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="arrow-storm"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Arrow Storm&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This bow fires three arrows, any spell that the bow has stored is applied to the arrow, and the +3 enchantment bonus (if better than the arrow) is as well. But see the &lt;strong&gt;Broken Item&lt;/strong&gt; section below. Though the bow can be given to players as a complete, unbroken version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="alert alert-warning "&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-warning"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Optional&lt;/strong&gt;: The bow can technically be used to fire at someone with arrow catching, which wouldn't waste the arrow. If this happens, the DM can allow more spells to be added to the arrow each time its fired. Though this obviously can lead to abuse. As long as your players use it for crazy hijinks, this can be a great addition
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section4&amp;quot;" id="flavour-text"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Flavour Text&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ability spawns the two additional arrows beside the original as it leaves the bow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="broken-item"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Broken Item&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ravaging Bow is made to seek out enemies, attempting to behead them if possible. However when it clones one of the arrows in the wrong position (aimed towards the user). Thus when attacking roll 2d20, one for the arrow flying towards you, and one for the arrows flying towards the enemy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="alert alert-success "&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-check-circle"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
You can have someone standing by with gloves of arrow catching to prevent any problems with arrows flying towards you. Remember to let the players figure out these things themselves.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="legend"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Legend&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the story is but a small excerpt from a much larger tale, the highlights shall be retold here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="alert alert-info "&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-info-circle"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Craka&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Sai&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Galthor&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Aegis&lt;/strong&gt; were Player Characters in this scene. &lt;strong&gt;Thrisperios&lt;/strong&gt; was an NPC
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Craka&lt;/strong&gt;: a barbarian wielding an artifact of power (&lt;em&gt;Silvia&lt;/em&gt;), &lt;strong&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/strong&gt;: an arcane archer wielding the &lt;strong&gt;Ravaging Bow&lt;/strong&gt; and the rest of the party enter a dragon's layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fighting the dragon (&lt;strong&gt;Sai&lt;/strong&gt;) high above a perilous drop, on a huge overhang, with a glorious battle and wounds all around, the party was pushed back, and with &lt;strong&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/strong&gt; near death, &lt;strong&gt;Sai&lt;/strong&gt; throws her off the overhang! With &lt;strong&gt;Sai&lt;/strong&gt; following after her, under the overhang to avoid damage from the members above. &lt;strong&gt;Craka&lt;/strong&gt;, thinking fast jumps down after them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activiting Backlash Drain (syncing all damage and healing between him and &lt;strong&gt;Sai&lt;/strong&gt;, and doing extra damage to both of them). &lt;strong&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/strong&gt; takes one last shot, hoping to defeat &lt;strong&gt;Sai&lt;/strong&gt; before he finishes her off, and rolls&amp;hellip; 2 natural 20's! (after confirming the crit) With &lt;strong&gt;Craka&lt;/strong&gt;'s and &lt;strong&gt;Sai&lt;/strong&gt;'s health being synced together, a triple beheading occurs as the three of them crash into the ground below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="alert alert-success "&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-check-circle"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
While the rest of the party was not mentioned, that in no way implies their lack of awesomeness, just that they weren't really part of the beheaded trio (In this case &lt;strong&gt;Galthor&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Aegis&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Thrisperios&lt;/strong&gt; (An NPC which &lt;strong&gt;Craka&lt;/strong&gt;'s Player took over)
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="alert alert-info "&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-info-circle"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
The rest of the tale will be posted sometime under "Zai'Ren: The Chronicles of &lt;em&gt;Silvia&lt;/em&gt;"
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

So I made a quick terminal command that freezes its processes. Of course I use this for pausing any of my apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section1&amp;quot;" id="overview"&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Overview&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="alert alert-info "&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-info-circle"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
You can see the code in my config file repository, along with my other bash aliases.
&lt;a href="bash-pauser"&gt;Click here to see the entire pause script&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I added the following bash functions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pause_process(pid)&lt;/code&gt;: nicer kill command that pauses a process (&lt;code&gt;kill -STOP&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pause_app(string)&lt;/code&gt;: searches for any proccesses with the given string, pausing them all&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as the opposing functions &lt;code&gt;resume_app()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;resume_process()&lt;/code&gt; (which use &lt;code&gt;kill -CONT&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section2&amp;quot;" id="implementation"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Implementation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="alert alert-info "&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-commenting"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
I'm not too great at bash, so if there's a better way to do this, do comment!
Thanks!
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First thing I needed was a nice way to work with lists in bash, so I made a function to map a command on each item.
Using that I made a function that searches for processes that contain a given string. Then it maps a command on them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;function &lt;/span&gt;map&lt;span class="o"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for &lt;/span&gt;pid in &lt;span class="sb"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;eval&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sb"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;pid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nv"&gt;PGREP_FLAGS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;-U ${USER}&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;function &lt;/span&gt;search_map&lt;span class="o"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    map &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;pgrep ${PGREP_FLAGS} -f \&amp;quot;$1\&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Using this the &lt;code&gt;pause_app()&lt;/code&gt; command is quite simple, and the resume_app one as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;function &lt;/span&gt;pause_app&lt;span class="o"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo &lt;/span&gt;pausing &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$1&lt;/span&gt;
    search_map &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;$1&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; pause_process;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section2&amp;quot;" id="usage"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this just requires knowing part of the app name:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;pause_app Chrome.app
pausing Chrome.app
  pausing:  378
  pausing:  406
  pausing:  414
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;resume_app Chrome.app
resuming Chrome.app
  resuming:  378
  resuming:  406
  resuming:  414
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="alert alert-warning "&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-warning"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;code&gt;pgrep&lt;/code&gt; will find more that one app if they contain the same text in the process tag.
The best search string is one which contains the entire app name, (or at least the &lt;code&gt;.app&lt;/code&gt; prefix)
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section2&amp;quot;" id="more-uses"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;More Uses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also made a bash script that freezes all the processes I consider extraneous to give my computer some resources during clinch moments. &lt;code&gt;pause_all&lt;/code&gt; reads a list of app names, mapping the pause script on them all. &lt;code&gt;resume_all&lt;/code&gt; does the opposite. You can see it &lt;a href="https://github.com/Saevon/config/blob/master/bash/pauser_template.bash"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section1&amp;quot;" id="reference"&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Reference&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/Saevon/config/blob/master/bash/pauser.bash"&gt;The entire pause Script&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/Saevon/config/blob/master/bash/pauser_template.bash"&gt;Pausing a list of apps at once&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section1&amp;quot;" id="situation"&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Situation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While writing my microkernel, it was necessary to add a machine specific context switch, for the ARM-920T processor. This meant I needed to add assembly to my C code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also needed to have my user tasks call syscall functions, which ended up being stubs for the &lt;code&gt;swi&lt;/code&gt; ARM assembly command. Thus I needed assembly there too, however it needed to share the &lt;code&gt;syscall_id&lt;/code&gt; value between the kernel syscall handler, and the user syscall stubs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section1&amp;quot;" id="how-to-create-the-code"&gt;&lt;h1&gt;How to create the code&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section2&amp;quot;" id="header-files"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Header files&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First comes the assemble helpers that will let us add immediate values using standard pre-processor constants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// asm.h&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#define immed(val) # ## val&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It simply defines adds a &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; in front of the value (since ARM assembly uses a hash sign to mark immediate values)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then define the function headers, so your C compiler knows that the functions will exist when you call the linker later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// syscall.h&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;priority&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Exit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Finally we have our shared &lt;code&gt;syscall_id&lt;/code&gt; definitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#define SYSCALL_ID_CREATE    1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#define SYSCALL_ID_EXIT      12&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section2&amp;quot;" id="assembly"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Assembly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="alert alert-info "&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-info-circle"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
The code highlighter doesn't support this, but the "@&amp;hellip;" lines are comments in ARM Assembly
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see the &lt;code&gt;immed(SYSCALL_ID_CREATE)&lt;/code&gt; doing its job to put the value properly into assembly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="no-pre-err"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;sycall.S&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c"&gt;#include &amp;lt;machine/asm.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;#include &amp;lt;kern/syscall_id.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="err"&gt;@-----------------------------------------------------------&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;.text&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;.align&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;.global&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;Create&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;.type&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="no"&gt;Create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nl"&gt;Create:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="err"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;pretend&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;frame&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="err"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;frame_needed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;uses_anonymous_args&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="err"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Push&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nf"&gt;stmfd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;sp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;r0-r1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="err"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Software&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;interrupt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;doing&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;syscall&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nf"&gt;swi&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;immed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;SYSCALL_ID_CREATE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="err"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Fix&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;stack&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;pointer&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nf"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;sp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;sp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c"&gt;#8&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="err"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Exit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;back&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;previous&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;frame&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="err"&gt;@-----------------------------------------------------------&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="err"&gt;@-----------------------------------------------------------&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;.text&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;.align&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;.global&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;Exit&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;.type&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="no"&gt;Exit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nl"&gt;Exit:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="err"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;pretend&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;frame&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="err"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;frame_needed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;uses_anonymous_args&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="err"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Software&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;interrupt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;doing&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;syscall&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nf"&gt;swi&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;immed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;SYSCALL_ID_EXIT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="err"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Exit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;back&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;previous&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;frame&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nf"&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;pc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;lr&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;.size&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="no"&gt;Exit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;.-Exit&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;@-----------------------------------------------------------&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section1&amp;quot;" id="how-to-set-up-your-makefile"&gt;&lt;h1&gt;How to set-up your Makefile&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we need to find each of the files, remember the &lt;code&gt;*.S&lt;/code&gt; files are your assembly + preproccessor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we convert their endings to the resulting files that we want: &lt;code&gt;*.o&lt;/code&gt; files&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Kernel libraries&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;ASMLIB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;shell find ./kern/asm/ -name &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;*.S&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;CLIB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;shell find ./kern/ -name &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;*.c&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nf"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;$(patsubst %.c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;%.o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;$(LIBS)) $(patsubst %.S&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;%.o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;$(ASMLIB))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Then we have the actual commands that will compile the files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that the &lt;code&gt;*.S&lt;/code&gt; files only get pre-processed by gcc (using the &lt;code&gt;-E&lt;/code&gt; flag). Then they follow the standard chain to become &lt;code&gt;*.o&lt;/code&gt; files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;%.s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;%.c&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;CC&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; -S &lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;CFLAGS&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; -o &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$@&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nf"&gt;%.o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;%.s&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;AS&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;ASFLAGS&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; -o &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$@&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nf"&gt;kern/asm/%.s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;kern/asm/%.S&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;CC&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; -E &lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;CFLAGS&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; -O0 -o &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$@&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Well there is a pretty simple solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section1&amp;quot;" id="overview"&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Overview&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently a friend of mine commented about something he read on reddit, people use gaze to figure out which way others are going. Now I'd been using this to avoid crowds, and even to indicate to my friends where to go next. However I realized that not many people know of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section1&amp;quot;" id="psychology"&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Psychology&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="alert alert-warning "&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-warning"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
No studies have been found supporting this, so treat this as pure theory and hearsay
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a person walks around, they will usually glance in the direction they're going. This can be used to find out where others are going, and most of us do so subconsciously. However, the real utility lies in getting through a crowded area. Anytime there are people going in the opposite direction, you can determinately look in between people, or to thier side, and they'll make room for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now one thing you might notice is that people who do a common courtesy (at least where I'm from), and glance into people's eyes, will be at a disadvantage. After all the other person now has no cues to tell where you'll be going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Saevon</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jul 2014 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag://blog.saevon.ca,2014-07-03:personal/psychology-walking/</guid><category>psychology</category></item><item><title>Using the proper Assembler on Mac OSX</title><link>//blog.saevon.ca/coding/using-the-proper-assembler-on-mac-osx/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The standard compiler &lt;code&gt;gcc&lt;/code&gt; for Mac OSX is actually the &lt;code&gt;clang&lt;/code&gt; compiler, this means that you need to use its assembler and linker as well. If you try to do the compilation in steps, you will notice that "&lt;code&gt;as&lt;/code&gt;" is not the clang assembler however, which causes it to break down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article I will discuss a simple solution to this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section1&amp;quot;" id="intro"&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Intro&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="alert alert-info "&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-info-circle"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
Jump straight to the &lt;a href="#solution"&gt;solution&lt;/a&gt;, or read about the situation ahead.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was working on a microkernel &lt;code&gt;(CS 452: Real Time Programming)&lt;/code&gt;, and I needed to do my compilations with a custom compiler, assembler and linker, so I could compile for ARM. However this required me to use an older version of gcc without the &lt;code&gt;--with-as=&lt;/code&gt; flag, thus I needed to get the assembler to run as a seperate command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter a complication: I needed this to run tests on my local machine (Mac), as well as on those of my partners (Windows running cygwin), I also needed this to compile on a remote Linux server, which could do the necessary cross-compilation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My resulting makefile had the following basic structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Create the assembly file so that we can use a seperate assembler in the next step&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nf"&gt;%.s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;%.c&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;CC&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; -S &lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;CFLAGS&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; -o &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$@&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Use out assembler to compile an object file&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nf"&gt;%.o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;%.s&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;AS&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;ASFLAGS&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; -o &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$@&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Combine the object files using the linker&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nf"&gt;%.elf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;%.o&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;LD&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;LDFLAGS&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; -Map &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$*&lt;/span&gt;.map -o &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$@&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$*&lt;/span&gt;.o &lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;INC&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; -lgcc
    chmod a+r &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$@&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;First we generate the assembly files, next we assemble the resulting files into object files. Finally we produce the elf file that will represent my Kernel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will run properly on the linux machine, however when I try to use the same makefile to generate code locally, it fails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section1&amp;quot;" id="solution"&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Solution&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The error I get looks like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;test_cbuf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Unknown&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pseudo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;op&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cfi_startproc&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;test_cbuf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Unknown&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pseudo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;op&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cfi_def_cfa_offset&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So the assemble results from &lt;code&gt;gcc&lt;/code&gt; can't be read by the assembler?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems the &lt;code&gt;gcc&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;as&lt;/code&gt; progams that Mac has by default use differing standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The correct assembler to use uses a command like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;clang -c -x assembler &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$@&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to solve my situation above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can give a different &lt;code&gt;AS = "clang -c -x assembler"&lt;/code&gt; variable to my makefile&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But then I either need to call it that way always (a pain) or add different instructions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can add a simple bash script that calls the code above, one that is earlier in my &lt;code&gt;$PATH&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I opted for the second solution, mostly since this seems to be a more common use-case for me.&lt;/p&gt;

You get a plot of land, and slowly build up a secure facility, getting money from the government for storing prisoners, and from grants (quests).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section2&amp;quot;" id="review"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Review&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="alert alert-warning "&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-warning"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
This game is in Alpha, thus many of the features I recommend and complain about could be planned for.
This game was pretty fun, don't drop it just cause of this review
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prison Architect was a pretty fun game to play, though I had some trouble at first, I slowly figured out how to make money and actually expand my prison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game itself involves mostly planning out your building and the rooms inside of it. So it lives up to its name as you really are an architect. There is of course more, such as planning out a regime for the prisoners, hiring staff, and setting up patrols, but the main focus is on design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section2&amp;quot;" id="gameplay"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gameplay&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="staff"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Staff&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Controlling your staff is still very raw, they just walk around doing whatever tasks they should do with no input from you. The only staff member you can really control is the Guard. A guard can be told to patrol, or to hang out around a specific room, or just to go somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main problem I saw with the staff, was that it was very hard to make multiple Cell Blocks. I tried to make a seperate High Security facility, but all of a sudden all my staff wanted to use its Staff Room to take breaks, "Oh look it has better wi-fi??". This also meant that some of my cooks decided to take over the Kitchen and my other one was understaffed, and other such problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="tutorial-descriptions"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tutorial &amp;amp; Descriptions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tutorial was pretty small, and had you start with an already running prison, this meant that I missed out on a lot of the requirements for how to actually build my prison, and instead learned the controls. Instead &lt;em&gt;Tips&lt;/em&gt; might have been more useful while I was building my prison from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While playing the actual game I found most of the object to be completely useless, as I had no idea what they do. I still have no Idea whether people used the TVs I installed, or if they did nothing. The game needs a more sims like interface, you can already see the different criteria for a prisoner's happiness, the in game objects just need a "Recreation++, Energy&amp;ndash;" that tells you the result of a prisoner using the object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some rooms actually have requirements for their use, such as a workshop needing 2 types of tables (a Saw and Press), and you can't tell how much of each you'll need in the room. A Kitchen has 3 things it needs, and I still am not sure how to make my cooks support more people. Thus the game needs an expanded information window for objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarily I filled up some rooms with useless looking items, why is a filing cabinet needed for an office? what happens if I install more? There should be some benefit, more importantly do prisoners use the chairs, sofas and tables that normally go for staff?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at utilities it was sometimes hard to work with overlapping water and electricity cables/pipes. Deleting just one was especially hard during such times. Also it wasn't obvious how much electricity/water an object would use, and big vs small pipes should also have a number indicating the maximum they can carry. Electricity also has 2 types of requirements, a &lt;em&gt;small&lt;/em&gt; cable, aka if its close enough to the electricity it automatically gets connected, and a &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt; cable, aka it needs a cable to connect to it. It would be nice to know which things need what, though as far as I can tell only lights need &lt;em&gt;small&lt;/em&gt; ones. This actually confused me for a bit as CCTV cameras seemed to work, but I guess I just coincidentally put them next to &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt; cables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="cell-blocks"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cell Blocks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier it was hard to divide the place into cell blocks, I could limit areas to staff only, or to max security, but my staff didn't care. So while I wanted a block to have next to no staff, in case of riots I close it down and call in the Riot squad, thus losing no people, I couldn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="prison-capacity"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Prison Capacity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the game you can either have your prison open for new prisoners, or not. It was annoying to have to open then close the prison, as I specifically made the place for 40 people. I couldn't just say my capacity is 40, then have prisoners come in, or better say the prison is for 30 Med risk, 5 Low risk and 5 High risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This meant that if my prison was running smoothly, and I needed some prisoners I would turn it on, then go start building my new wing, and forget to turn it back off! Thus I would be over capacity, I knew it was too late, a riot was about to happen as the prisoners near starved. But I could do nothing, it would have been nice to ship people back out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="rooms"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Rooms&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game allows for a very nice variaty of rooms, I felt pretty satisfied by them. While more might be nice, it had all I really needed for a prison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only real problem I saw with rooms was the minimum size requirements, 5x5 for a holding cell? why not 4*7. Maybe a 25m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; limit instead?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="riots"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Riots&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike some of the other people online, I had no problem keeping the number of riots down, and once I got a base prison working riots only happened when I screwed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However I'm not sure why, but the prisoners just ran around breaking stuff and killing guards, not trying to escape? Perhaps this was an AI thing though as my prison was sort of confusingly layed out (all the better to trap people in).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/section&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Saevon</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jan 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag://blog.saevon.ca,2014-01-08:review/review-prison-architect/</guid><category>prison architect</category><category>game</category></item><item><title>Mystic Eye Collection Goggles</title><link>//blog.saevon.ca/roleplaying/mystic-eye-collection-goggles/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magical Item:&lt;/strong&gt; A cursed pair of eye goggles that is used to steal the eyes of creatures. It doubles as a torture device due to its method of extracting them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="summary"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attacks creatures within &lt;strong&gt;30 feet&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1/rnd&lt;/strong&gt; do a &lt;strong&gt;Ref 20&lt;/strong&gt; or be forced to wear them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concentration 16&lt;/strong&gt; or launch an eye every &lt;strong&gt;10rnds&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When shapeshifting with eyes, you get its abilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Takes up the &lt;strong&gt;Headband&lt;/strong&gt; slot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cursed Item&lt;/strong&gt;: Can't be taken off&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="extraction"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Extraction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any creature wearing these goggles will see red marks appearing over everything they focus on. The more they focus on something the brighter the mark on it. The less they focus, the darker (or non-existent) the mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a creature focuses on something for too long they feel some pressure build up behind their eyes, until, the eye is popped out of its socket, and launched towards the targeted mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an eye is launched, a hard protective case is build up around it in the shape of a cylindrical glass container, a &lt;em&gt;Stasis Glass&lt;/em&gt;. The eye is held in a stasis field which prevents any damage unless the container itself is opened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="how-its-used"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How it's Used&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goggles are attracted to any creature with eyes that is within 1 size category of its size. When within &lt;strong&gt;30 feet&lt;/strong&gt; of such a creature they fly at their eyes, attaching themselves. The target gets a &lt;strong&gt;Reflex Save (DC: 20)&lt;/strong&gt; to block, though the goggles will keep trying &lt;strong&gt;1/rnd&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Every 10rnds&lt;/strong&gt; hereafter the target will need to do a &lt;strong&gt;concentration check (DC: 16)&lt;/strong&gt; to not focus too much (and launch 1 eye).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goggles are considered a &lt;strong&gt;Headband&lt;/strong&gt; magical item, thus preventing you from using any goggles, eye glasses or other such items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goggles are considered a cursed item for the sake of getting them off, thus &lt;strong&gt;Remove Curse&lt;/strong&gt; will make them fall off, after which they will take &lt;strong&gt;1d10&lt;/strong&gt; rnds to recover (launching one of their eyes on failure).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goggles are usually encountered as a stranded item, acting like a trap. However in reality these Goggles are used to collect Mystic Eyes, thus there is a way to control them. The Goggles are created with a small container to hold them. The container has an arcane symbol to press when you need to stop the goggles from attacking things, and another to get them to start up again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="stasis-glass"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Stasis Glass&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any eye in a Stasis Glass can't get any damage until the container breaks. This makes it the best way to store eyes until you have a need for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to a quirk in its production any shapeshifting while holding an eye grants the user that eye. This takes up the &lt;strong&gt;Headband&lt;/strong&gt; slot, preventing any other magic items from functioning. You can have as many eye changes as is available to your current form, thought this is mandatory. Using this you can change eye colour, shape and other such details. If you hold more eyes than your form has, you get to choose which ones work (or roll for randomness).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hardness:&lt;/strong&gt; 15&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HP:&lt;/strong&gt; 20&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aura:&lt;/strong&gt; Strong Transmutation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Stasis glass is broken, it disappears, but the contents fall out (and are probably ruined)&lt;/p&gt;

Re-invent your favourite games, combat piracy, or even embrace it. Its a unique game due to its differing gameplay between the legit and pirated versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section2&amp;quot;" id="review"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Review&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick warning, this review is written just before the move to the 3rd office, and thus might not fully reflect all the game options. I just felt it was best to write this while its fresh in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greenheartgames.com/2013/04/29/what-happens-when-pirates-play-a-game-development-simulator-and-then-go-bankrupt-because-of-piracy/"&gt;See this link for details about the piracy aspect.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="controls"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Controls&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game uses a menu for most of its controls, you click on the screen and a menu opens up. I found this a bit unweldy, as sometimes this meant it went above the other icons at the top, making them hard to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also a minor bug that made me sometimes manipulate a menu in the background while I was on the "New Game" window. I'd be trying to click to type the game name, but be clicking on menu options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One suggestion which I thought would be nice, would be to highlight staff when you hover over them, that would make it more obvious that there are seperate menus. Thought it was pretty clear after a click or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="gameplay"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Gameplay&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found the game was a bit confusing, I was always just guessing what options to choose, and sometimes the game I imagined and the game that I apparantly made didn't match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game creation menu was nice, but sometimes I wish I could cross some genres such as Zombie/Horror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three stages were also a little confusing, I had already made tons of games by this point, yet the requirements still eluded me. If I was actually making games, after that many games and game reports I would have long since compiled the effects of each stage on the topics and genres. While I sometime get hints saying "+++?" it just didn't seem like I was getting enough for my efforts, sure I could have actually written reports myself, but this is a casual game to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also found the "Design" and "Technology" bubbles to be confusing, I had no idea what it meant to get better points there, except that it was probably good. Nor how each staff member and choice could effect it. My characters had stats, but I couldn't figure out why I'd care for that very reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research was pretty well done, I found that I could mostly guess when I'd get lots of research points, it was intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When choosing projects to work on, I felt I should have more control over who does what. While I could train, and research individually, it would be nice to do that as a group as well, especially if the rest of my team has nothing to do. Conversely I felt that my staff could produce multiple games, as I could do them by myself at the start, especially when I really needed money, and didn't mind going red to get money faster&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a similar topic, the medium game didn't tell me my team would have been swamped and incapable of finishing it without giving 130% each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="graphics"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Graphics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found the graphics to be to my liking, the cartoonish sprites, and backgrounds to be very fitting. They didn't take too much of the focus, making you see the whole office as important, rather than focusing on your individual avatar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the avatar, I found there wasn't too much options for making an avatar, I think hair style and colour could have been seperated. Otherwise I had all the options I needed to get someone I liked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time bar at the top left was not very well done either, as I found the numbers just faded away and were unimportant to me. If it was more obvious what year it was (1980 + the given year I guess) it might have been nice, especially when I was talking to my friends about how I released these cool games in (what year would this be again?). I remember one conversation vividly, where my friend stated, "maybe the world isn't ready for your ground breaking Zombie/Sim :P", and I took forever to figure out what year that was in real time. The other time values could have been better shown as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="sounds"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sounds&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found the sounds were okay, they were reminiscent of the much older games I liked to play, and totally fit in with the time and feel of the game. However there wasn't much more about them, thus I can see how the developers took their own gameplay to heart, not putting much effort into the sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall I did like them, and feel that the game really didn't need much effort in this category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section2&amp;quot;" id="conclusion"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This game was a very fun game, however I still felt there was room for improvement. I wish the best of luck to the developers of this game, and hope their sequel or expansion is awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section2&amp;quot;" id="reference"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Reference&lt;/h2&gt;

Here I show you how to separate your system packages and that of your project environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section1&amp;quot;" id="intro"&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Intro&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jump "straight" to the &lt;a href="#Syspip"&gt;Syspip&lt;/a&gt; section if you know all about python packaging and virtualenv.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section1&amp;quot;" id="virtualenvwrapper"&gt;&lt;h1&gt;virtualenvwrapper&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a really useful tool, even if it adds binaries with amazingly long names. It lets you easily and quickly list, add, and switch to a virtualenv.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't usually need all the many options this script provides, and would also prefer for it to be easier to combine the virtualenvwrapper's and git's PS1 prompt changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="changing-environments"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Changing Environments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To change environments is pretty easy, you just use the &lt;code&gt;workon&lt;/code&gt; command. This works whether you have a currently active environment or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;workon &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$env_name&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To deactivate the current environment you use the &lt;code&gt;deactivate&lt;/code&gt; command, just like normal. Though personally I though workoff was more obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;alias &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;workoff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;deactivate
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="tab-completion"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tab Completion!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When using the &lt;code&gt;workon&lt;/code&gt; command you can tab complete to see the list of all the environments you have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="addremove-environments"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Add/Remove Environments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Add a new environment&lt;/span&gt;
mkvirtualenv &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$env_name&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Remove an environment&lt;/span&gt;
rmvirtualenv &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$env_name&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section1&amp;quot;" id="syspip"&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Syspip&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heres where stuff gets interesting. To prevent mistakes while installing packages, I've added the following things to my bash startup scripts (&lt;code&gt;.bashrc&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.bash_aliases&lt;/code&gt;, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# .bashrc&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt; /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;export &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;WORKON_HOME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$HOME&lt;/span&gt;/.environments
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;export &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;PIP_VIRTUALENV_BASE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;WORKON_HOME

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;export &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;First notice that we set &lt;code&gt;PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV&lt;/code&gt;, this ensures that pip &lt;em&gt;will not&lt;/em&gt; run without an active virtual environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, do remember to set &lt;code&gt;PIP_VIRTUALENV_BASE&lt;/code&gt;, since that is what pip uses to tell if you have an environment active. (AFAIK)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# .bash_aliases&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;export &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;SYSTEM_PIP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sb"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;which pip&lt;span class="sb"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;function &lt;/span&gt;syspip &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nv"&gt;PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; sudo &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$SYSTEM_PIP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;$@&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here we first find which version of pip we use, then add a new way of using the global pip binary. Now you have 2 ways of installing a package, each of which always installs to the expected location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To install &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; for the currently active environment, (or fail if it doesn't find one)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;pip install &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$package&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To install &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; globally&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;syspip install &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$package&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="alert alert-warning "&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-warning"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
Don't forget to load &lt;code&gt;.bash_aliases&lt;/code&gt; before you activate any environments, otherwise &lt;code&gt;syspip&lt;/code&gt; might not work as advertised.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Having been secretly trained as a spy from birth, he's coerced into working for the MI6 and always ends up saving the world from unknown catastrophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section2&amp;quot;" id="review"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Review&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been a while since I last read books from the Alex Rider series, but I can tell you they're worth re-reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general plot follows Alex as he gets into difficult situations and uses his wits, training, and cool gadgets to escape hazards. He often not only triumphs, but comes out ahead, finding some new source of information which helps him uncover the final evil plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series is quite easy to be immersed in, and nicely portrays the problems and challenges a spy might be facing. Some potential inaccuracy does exist, however it is outshadowed by the greater benefit it usually presents to the overall story. You can see that the author did his research, and consulted experts in quite a few fields when writing his books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main characteristics of this series is that Alex does not often wish to follow along with every Secret Service's requests for help. This is very realistic portrayal of the most likely reaction of a kid put in the situation he faces, and while I would prefer not to see him being coerced into these situations, it makes Alex seem much more normal and provides more believability to the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evil villains of the Alex Rider universe do follow the standard James Bond procedure, but all seem to have unique quirks that make them much more. Not all of them would blab out their evil plan when Alex is caught and about to be killed, though most of them do end up leaving him to die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychology plays a big part in the series, as we see Alex get hurt mentally with everything he goes through, and even though he seems to get back up a little too resiliently, it makes reading the books all the more accurate and enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Saevon</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jul 2013 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag://blog.saevon.ca,2013-07-08:review/review-alex-rider/</guid><category>alex rider</category><category>book</category></item><item><title>WebRTC with JsSIP and Asterisk</title><link>//blog.saevon.ca/coding/webrtc-with-jssip-and-asterisk/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I've been trying to get a web phone up and running, my only real requirement was to use Asterisk. So I decided to go with the following technology stack, JsSIP, Chrome and Asterisk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section2&amp;quot;" id="browsers"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Browsers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've only tried to use chrome so far, though I've read that Firefox is currently WebRTC capable as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chrome on OSX seems to work fine (version 27.0.1453.116).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chrome on Ubuntu had problems until I updated to a &lt;a href="http://www.ubuntuupdates.org/package/google_chrome/stable/main/base/google-chrome-beta"&gt;Beta version&lt;/a&gt; (version 28.0.1500.52 beta)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section2&amp;quot;" id="asterisk"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Asterisk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asterisk had quite a few requirements before I could get it to work with WebRTC, &lt;a href="https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/display/AST/Asterisk+WebRTC+Support" title="Asterisk and WebRTC"&gt;see this page for details&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section4&amp;quot;" id="building"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Building&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will likely need to rebuild Asterisk as WebRTC requires a SRTP libraries, which aren't included by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will need the following libraries on the machine you use to recompile Asterisk:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;libssl-dev&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;libsrtp0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have these libraries installed, you will also need to enable two Asterisk resources:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;res_srtp.so&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;res_http_websocket.so&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you can recompile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resulting build might also need a few configuration changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;etc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;asterisk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;|--&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;conf&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;|--&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;modules&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;conf&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;|--&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;conf&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;http.conf&lt;/code&gt;
    Ensure the following options are set&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;enabled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;yes&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;bindaddr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0.0.0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;bindport&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8088&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;modules.conf&lt;/code&gt;
    you must load res_http_websocket.so before chan_sip.so&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sip.conf&lt;/code&gt;
    Any users that you want to allow WebRTC for you need:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;encryption&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;yes&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;avpf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;yes&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;transport&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ws&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;wss&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;icesupport&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;yes&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Adding &lt;strong&gt;encryption=yes&lt;/strong&gt; to any non WebRTC phones might make them break, so be careful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="alert alert-info "&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-info-circle"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
Remember to restart Asterisk once you're done.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section2&amp;quot;" id="jssip"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;JsSIP&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JsSIP &lt;a href="http://jssip.net/" title="JsSip"&gt;JsSIP&lt;/a&gt; was quite easy to use, however it wasn't without its set of problems. If you want to do a quick test yourself, check out the &lt;a href="https://jssip.tryit.net" title="JsSip Tryit"&gt;JsSIP Tryit&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main problem was that their script didn't seem to connect with asterisk properly, though I've already forgotten the reason (will update if I do). To solve this I updated to the dev version of JsSIP, which I download from the &lt;a href="https://jssip.tryit.net" title="JsSip Tryit"&gt;JsSIP Tryit&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterwards I would also have jssip error out when I tried to type in an invalid target, I patched it quickly removing the potentially erroneous code. I didn't know enough about their side of the problem, so I have no way of knowing if this is a correct fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="alert alert-warning "&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-warning"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
I've included the patch below, use it at your own risk.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="gh"&gt;Index: /static/js/jssip-devel.js&lt;/span&gt;

       } else {

     };
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section2&amp;quot;" id="conclusion"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WebRTC is clearly still a work in progress, and I hope it gets polished up nicely for when I next wish to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I've finally decided to get myself a blog, after seeing a few options I decided to go with Jekyll and Github Pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section2&amp;quot;" id="purpose"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Purpose&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel this blog could combine most of my passions, coding, movies, and anything else I feel like blogging about. To that end my goal is to separate the main page into multiple post groups. Each group would let you see new posts from that category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I add more topics I will update this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section4&amp;quot;" id="coding"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Coding&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would list any CS related topics, and though the title is "Coding" it would include algorithms and other such theoretical topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section4&amp;quot;" id="media"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Media&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would be a conglomeration of any movies, books, and other such topics. Mostly this will compose of reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section4&amp;quot;" id="rant"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Rant&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miscellaneous talks will go here&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section2&amp;quot;" id="conclusion"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="alert alert-success "&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-noicon"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Thank you&lt;/strong&gt; for reading this far
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expect to see many changes for the next months as I customize this blog and personalize as much as I can.&lt;/p&gt;
