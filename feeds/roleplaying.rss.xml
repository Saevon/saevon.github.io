Many new passages and possibilities were found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section2&amp;quot;" id="cast"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cast&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zantar&lt;/strong&gt; (Human? Mage): Sorceror&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jack&lt;/strong&gt; (Half-Nymph Hunter): Archer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zaire&lt;/strong&gt; (Human Ninja): Dark Rogue&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Played by &lt;strong&gt;SyC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Artix the Uncanny&lt;/strong&gt; (Gnome Inventor): Artificer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Played by &lt;strong&gt;Cr4ka&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moonshai, Disciple of the Great Dracolich&lt;/strong&gt; (Kobold Warlock):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section2&amp;quot;" id="story"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Underneath a dense canopy of vines and brush the small band of souls and perhaps lost souls venture forth. Hoping to find some sort of answer to explain any of the strange occurrences that have befallen them and the world above. In a faint call, almost a whisper yet surprisingly clear,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There is a clearing up ahead, you gotta come see this" informed Zaire the Invisible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Now what?" responded Moonshai in an annoyed tone while looking sideways at weasel twice his size. Thinking to himself, "How did I, the worshipper of the Great Dracolich, the future Tribe Leader of Small-kin, end up babysitting this thing?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dire weasel just licked his face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little up ahead the locally proclaimed "vampire" Nymph was swinging his naginata in a vigorous and masterful manner slicing off vines that got in the way. Although being one with nature generally meant not destroying a plant simply because it was in the way, but there was something odd about these vines, something that just didn't sit right with Jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right behind him a figure with a majestic hawk perched on his shoulder, Zantar "the undead", was double checking his magical components. Pouch with various mineral dusts, check. Small animal bones and feathers, check. Then a small sigh of pride escaped his mouth as he patted a small pouch on his belt. His newest addition, the perfect blend of sulfur and grade A quality bat guano. Check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oblivious to the upcoming clearing, a hunched figure stumbled close behind Zantar. Artix's attention focused on some piece of mechanism in his hands. Out of his mouth came a spur of whispering noises which generally sound like a bunch of hissing. But to any nearby time travellers that could slow down time about 10 fold, they would hear some odd cursing, something to do with too many elbows getting in the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the trail opened up a great pink crystal towered above the treetops all the way up to the ceiling of the cavern. Trapped inside the pink, the skeletal remains of a draconic creature of old. Around the crystal a skeletal centipede spiralled almost as if constricting the whole structure. Around, were a series of ring indents and on each ring atop a stone base stood a statue depicting a combat stance centered on the crystal itself. These statues portrayed a hardy barbarian, a heroic fighter, and a cunning wizard, all but the barbarian with their weapons clearly missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some 50 ft above two huge gouts of water were hitting the crystal as if two colossal sized giants were having a pissing contest, but neither was willing to give up. By an unknown magic the water seemed to dissipate into nothingness upon impact. This motion intrigued the local artificer with a slight fear of water who at this point began constructing a 51 ft poking stick. At the same time Zaire and Zantar began investigating the statues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The base of each statue contains a notch that perfectly fits inside the circular grooves," reasoned Zaire "Then perhaps it may be possible to move these statues along the grooves."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a short struggle as they attempted to push the fighter statue along the groove, but it was quickly determined that the statues are far too heavy, as if they were made from an extremely dense material such as stone. With physical efforts leading nowhere Zantar's greed took over. Knowing that statues in this particular temple/cavern/dungeon are prone to have secret compartments with goodies, he began casting a spell to detect secret treasures. Coincidentally Zantar just recently began to master the deviously hilarious language of draconic and decided to use it to cast his spell. Well due to his noviceness in the draconic tongue he mispronounced the phrase "secret treasure" and instead ended up saying "secret passage" thus resulting in a different magical effect. Due to this minor alteration he located some secret tunnels up in the dense tree canopy surrounding the clearing. Everyone flashed back to a previous ambush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Tatzlwyrm," they all spoke in unison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general consensus was to stay clear of the secret tunnels. Except for Jack who decided, that despite the likelihood of the results, someone must investigate the tunnels and began scaling a tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After an anticlimactic experience with the statues Zaire turned his attention to the giant pink rock. After circling it a few times and looking for some proper foot holds he decided to run up the vertical wall of the crystal. Perhaps if anyone could actually see Zaire then he may have been slightly embarrassed at that moment, because it was the first time in his life that he could not run up a vertical wall. This was due to some odd repulsion field that pushed back when he approached the center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually Artix completed his 51ft pole and maneuvered it into one of the gouts of water. The momentum of the flying water caught the edge of the pole and pulled it violently towards the crystal, causing the pole to explode into a shower of damp splinters. Which in some oriental lands is known to be a pleasant acupuncture technique when the correct types of wood are used, this was not that case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack's luck ran out when he fell out of the tree with the secret tunnels and barely managed to not break his face, but fate is a bitch and some things are just meant to happen, just not yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As ingenuity dwindled Zantar decided that a more spiritual approach was in order and began an interpretive dance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What are you doing?" asked Artix as he watched Zantar make a fool of himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I am performing a spiritual dance to entice whatever memories out of the crystal and into my audience," Zantar responded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Hmmm, and then what?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Well that's easy, we snatch 'em and figure out what the deal is with this here crystal."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still unsure with the validity of the plan Artix decided to begin some vague religious spirit summoning chant. Partially hoping to help this plan along, but mostly to make this look like a proper ritual incase anyone else was looking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magic works in weird ways and this time it decided to convince Artix that not holding things with hands was totally normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'm still not seeing any memories, perhaps some psychedelic herbs could help&amp;hellip;" implied Zantar, while dancing like a crown bearer carrying a 400lb elaborate headpiece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing absolutely no downside to this suggestion and a huge stockpile of herbs Artix begins to search through the herbs with his feet. Any other herbalist would cringe at the sight of a delicate shadow rose, whose market value could purchase a small town, being crushed between the dirty toes of a gnome. Nevertheless an Illusioner's cap was located and ingested by the sole dancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Zaire and Jack decided that being injured and having no powers was unacceptable they decided to rest. Consequently the interpreted dance was delayed until more psychedelic conditions present themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"How are my pupils?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; "Normal"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having nothing to do the group backtracked to a safer location near the crying statue fountain. Keen to show his acrobatic abilities, Zaire tumbled into a tight spot in the fountain causing a clicking noise upon landing on the floor. He then proceeded to fall asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"How are my pupils?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Normal," doubted Artix, and having realized that holding with hands was a good idea, decided to double check the drugs eaten by Zantar. It was not an Illusioner's cap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then a strange fog befell the area. Ideas of compressed corn and bacteria processed milk clouded the minds of past. When the fog settled&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mechanical valve protruded out of the fountain where Zaire had slept. It was rotated sunwise and counter-sunwize but the result was the same, nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rude valve which refused to do anything regardless of how much attention it was getting, ended up getting the silent treatment. Upon realizing that Jack was no longer in the vicinity of fountain area the remaining humanoid creatures and weasel continued down a newly found dried creek with a conveniently naginata cut tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere down the path a nymph was furiously hacking at a wall of vines that dared not move aside when asked nicely. Due to some temporal discrepancies but more likely due to Zaire's ability to run really quickly as compared to everyone else, a ninja and a nymph stood before an opening covered with a whole lot of vines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Send in the clones!" demanded Jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"No"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Cmon just do it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"No"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Well then hold me up while I check this out."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Fine," conceded Zaire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Fate stopped being lazy and finally caught up to Jack, or perhaps this was a way for the vines to get revenge for their fallen comrades. Regardless because as Jack pulled apart some vines a small &lt;em&gt;blupe&lt;/em&gt; of lava splashed on his right cheek. On the plus side he no longer needs to open his mouth in order to breath through it. No further inquiries into the opening where made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all know that magic is strange and since this place is full of it perhaps that is why Moonshai decided to speak as if he had an opinion to say. He also developed a sense of empathy upon seeing Jack's horrendous hole in the side of his face. After some careful consideration,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Well he did give one of my most trusted friends a proper burial," Moonshai decided that Jack was indeed worthy of one charge of the wand of cure moderate wounds. Perhaps this is the start of a beautiful friendship, but it is definitely the start of a lot of mooching off Moonshai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The party realized that the creek from the fountain leads to the crystal and the grooved rings. This meant that perhaps turning on the fountain could in some way benefit them and cause unexpected results. Having absolutely no idea how mechanisms work in this fortification, they decided that the pump-like machines a few hundred feet below the fountain must be related.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Determined to get the only friendly "mechanic" to the pumps, Moonshai began to experiment with his carrying capabilities while flying. He was lifting some gnome sized rocks before realizing that gnomes are stubborn and they prefer not to get burned by lava elementals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead the humanoids and weasel scaled down to the main river and embarked on a raft ride to the laboratory on the opposite side of the fortification. Along the northern section of the river, Artix recognized the location of his first brief encounter with the Urthak. It was a wide rock hill with a waterfall crashing at the top. This was the same water that flowed through the kobold temple near the surface and contained strange mind altering abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the journey was short and was only delayed by an opening in the lava treatment section of the fort. Barely avoiding a party split, the group arrived before the windows to the laboratory. Where a ninja clone attempted to jump through the glass, but instead bounced off it with a satisfying thump and a small bump on his head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="summary"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take up a &lt;strong&gt;ring&lt;/strong&gt; slot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show the direction (3D) and distance of the partner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show the Health and Status of the partner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Often a Ring of Protection +1 to +5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="_1"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Saevon</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 13 Oct 2015 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag://blog.saevon.ca,2015-10-13:roleplaying/engagement-rings/</guid><category>magic-item</category><category>D&amp;D</category></item><item><title>Glove of Storing</title><link>//blog.saevon.ca/roleplaying/glove-of-storing/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magic-Item:&lt;/strong&gt; A glove which stores up to 5 vials of substance, releasing them into your palm with a gesture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="summary"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold up to 5 vials&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Immediate Action to take one out (and maybe use it)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Takes up one &lt;strong&gt;glove&lt;/strong&gt; slot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="storing"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Storing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These gloves can hold up to &lt;strong&gt;5 vials&lt;/strong&gt;, these can be any potions, oils, poisons, etc. Taking one of them out is a &lt;strong&gt;immediate action&lt;/strong&gt;, putting one back in is a &lt;strong&gt;movement action&lt;/strong&gt; that provokes an &lt;strong&gt;AoO&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often these gloves don't come as pairs, but you can equip 2 of them to take up the full glove slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="alert alert-warning "&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-warning"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
Using the item once its in your hand means following the applicable rules, drinking portions, throwing alchemy items, coating a weapon, etc. Thus they might still provoke AoO, or take time. However if the item takes a &lt;strong&gt;Free&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Immediate&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Swift&lt;/strong&gt; Action, it can be folded into the act of activating the gloves.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don't need to hold on to the item as it appears: dropping an item doesn't take an action. Thus you can have a vial of alchemists fire that you can drop at your feet as a immediate action (interrupt?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common use for these gloves is in conjunction with the &lt;a href="//blog.saevon.ca/roleplaying/teleportation-vial/"&gt;Teleportation Vial&lt;/a&gt; to teleport out of harms way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="legend"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Legend&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the story is but a small excerpt from a much larger tale, the highlights shall be retold here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="alert alert-info "&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-info-circle"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Craka&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Galthor&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Aegis&lt;/strong&gt; were Player Characters in this scene. &lt;strong&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Thrisperios&lt;/strong&gt; were still NPCs
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Craka&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Aegis&lt;/strong&gt; had appeared in the middle of the Assasin's Guild, and while they had made a bit of a mess &lt;strong&gt;Galthor&lt;/strong&gt; was still impressed with them. Deciding that they'd passed their trials, it was time for their first mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their new team was fleshed out with &lt;strong&gt;Galthor&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/strong&gt; joining them, and their job was to find the 2nd Prince of the Land, &lt;strong&gt;Thrisperios&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="alert alert-info "&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-info-circle"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
Timeskip! The &lt;a href="{filename}dice-chaos.md"&gt;Chaos Party&lt;/a&gt; happened during this timeskip.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having followed &lt;strong&gt;Silvia&lt;/strong&gt;'s directions, and having excavated a strange doorway, the party found that it was a portal to the Ethreal Plane. Travel in the Ethreal Plane is quite difficult, and the &lt;strong&gt;Prince&lt;/strong&gt; was underground. So deciding to use the connection between the two planes, they dug a hole in the Material Plane, then used that passage in the Ethreal Plane to get to the &lt;strong&gt;Prince&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;strong&gt;Aegis&lt;/strong&gt; going ahead as a Blink Dog, using dimension door to travel (&lt;strong&gt;Aegis&lt;/strong&gt;: Which is quite ingenious), the rest of the group tried to remain hidden. Introducing himself to the &lt;strong&gt;Prince&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Aegis&lt;/strong&gt; was able to gain his friendship. However when &lt;strong&gt;Craka&lt;/strong&gt; introduced himself as well, something caught the &lt;strong&gt;Prince&lt;/strong&gt;'s suspicion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;strong&gt;Craka&lt;/strong&gt; not being trusted, he was forced to remain behind, following along with the other two assassin. Finding another set of Ruins, similar to the ones they found in the Crater, the &lt;strong&gt;Prince&lt;/strong&gt; turned out to be capable of opening doors in this area. With &lt;strong&gt;Aegis&lt;/strong&gt; secretly letting the rest of the party in, they continued trying to learn more about the &lt;strong&gt;Prince&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile &lt;strong&gt;Galthor&lt;/strong&gt;, being a rebel and all, decided this was his best chance to get rid of anyone who wanted to assassinate the &lt;strong&gt;Prince&lt;/strong&gt;. Attacking &lt;strong&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/strong&gt;, sealing as many of her abilities as possible, and nearly finishing her off in the initial strike. &lt;strong&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/strong&gt; however wasn't a skilled assassin for nothing, always having an escape plan available! Activating her &lt;strong&gt;Gloves of Storing&lt;/strong&gt;, and breaking the &lt;strong&gt;Teleportation Vial&lt;/strong&gt;, she quickly escaped around corners, heading towards the &lt;strong&gt;Prince&lt;/strong&gt;'s last known location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confusing &lt;strong&gt;Craka&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Galthor&lt;/strong&gt; convinced him that &lt;strong&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/strong&gt; had betrayed them! Meanwhile &lt;strong&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/strong&gt;, having found the &lt;strong&gt;Prince&lt;/strong&gt;, used her grivious injuries to convince the &lt;strong&gt;Prince&lt;/strong&gt; that she was a rebel. With &lt;strong&gt;Craka&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Aegis&lt;/strong&gt; able to communicate through &lt;strong&gt;Silvia&lt;/strong&gt; they decided that they'd keep the two parties away from each other until they could figure out the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="alert alert-info "&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-info-circle"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
The rest of the tale will be posted sometime under "Zaii'Ren: The Chronicles of &lt;em&gt;Silvia&lt;/em&gt;"
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="summary"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free Action to crush one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dimension Door: &lt;em&gt;Conjuration (Teleportation)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aura&lt;/strong&gt;: Moderate Conjuration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="dimension-door"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Dimension Door&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you crush one of these vials, you teleport in the indicated direction (where you're pointing, any distance) as if by &lt;strong&gt;Dimension Door&lt;/strong&gt;. You can't use the "visualizing the location method", but you can teleport into an unknown location. You also cannot bring another creature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common use for these vials is in conjunction with the &lt;a href="//blog.saevon.ca/roleplaying/glove-of-storing/"&gt;Storing Gloves&lt;/a&gt; to teleport out of harms way. The gloves drop a vial into your hand as an immediate action, and then you can crush one as part of that action, thus using it as an easy escape out of danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="alert alert-warning "&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-warning"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
Remember &lt;strong&gt;Dimension Door&lt;/strong&gt; ends your turn.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="legend"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Legend&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story is told in the &lt;a href="//blog.saevon.ca/roleplaying/glove-of-storing/"&gt;Legend of the Storing Gloves&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Its main purpose is to absorb all magic, refusing to be sheathed if its purpose isn't met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="summary"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;+3 flutter blade (1Handed, 1d4+1d6 piercing or slashing, 19-20 Crit)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move action to switch between slashing and piercing damage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Symbols on it pulse with a faint sky blue light (rad 10' bright, rad 15' shadowy)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Merciful&lt;/strong&gt;: Only does subdual damage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mage Killer&lt;/strong&gt;: On successful hit can steal magic (see below)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;+6 vs Magic items or effects (see below)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cursed Item&lt;/strong&gt;: You can't sheathe the blade without draining magic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="mage-killer"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Mage Killer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every successful hit with this blade steals magic, choose one of the following for the blade to eat:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Up 6 spell levels worth of spells/day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Up to 2 uses of a &lt;strong&gt;Su&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Sp&lt;/strong&gt; ability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One infinite use &lt;strong&gt;Su&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Sp&lt;/strong&gt; ability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any spell affect currently on the user&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any effects of a magical item, disabling it for 1 hour&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a magical item provides multiple bonuses, only one is disabled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;e.g. +2 Keen Flaming Weapon: Only one of those 3 effects can be stolen per attack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that any ability that is the equivalent of a &lt;strong&gt;7th&lt;/strong&gt; level spell or higher cannot be stolen. Also Kaern's Blade cannot affect artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a &lt;strong&gt;Confirmed Critical&lt;/strong&gt; instead of doing bonus damage, the user can steal the magic instead, being able to store it in the blade for up to &lt;strong&gt;1 Hour&lt;/strong&gt;. The user can then cast/use as if he is the original source of the magic. If the original source is destroyed, the magic is lost as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The owner can specifically choose to target an effect or magical item, treat this as a &lt;strong&gt;called shot&lt;/strong&gt;, but with a &lt;strong&gt;+6 Echantment&lt;/strong&gt; bonus. However when using this the weapon does no damage at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="alert alert-info "&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-info-circle"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Optional&lt;/strong&gt;: You can even have the blade be able to absorb magic being cast on it. If the user readies a standard action to defend himself from magic, they can make an attack roll against the opponents caster level check.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="merciful"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Merciful&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blade refuses to kill any living being, specifically any creature termed alive, intelligent or soulled, doing only subdual damage to these creatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When this blade deals damage treat it as normal for the purposes of &lt;strong&gt;Damage Resistance&lt;/strong&gt;. Then apply all damage as &lt;strong&gt;subdual damage&lt;/strong&gt; to the creature. The blade cannot take a creature below &lt;strong&gt;-5 HP&lt;/strong&gt;, refusing to damage said creatures. It can still steal magic from them however. Note that some creatures are soulled, but can't go below &lt;strong&gt;0 HP&lt;/strong&gt; in which case they are brought to at most &lt;strong&gt;1 HP&lt;/strong&gt;, and any further damage from Kaern's Blade causes them to be &lt;strong&gt;Disabled&lt;/strong&gt;: unable to do any mental or physical actions until &lt;strong&gt;8 hours* or they have &lt;/strong&gt;1 HP** worth of healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ability is also affected by the owner's thoughts. Thus if an animated item was seen as a "pet" by the owner, the blade would refuse to destroy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section4&amp;quot;" id="flavour-text"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Flavour Text&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ability manifests as the blade passing through opponents, and causing them to feel more and more exhausted, or . Thus the blade is still used to slash or stab, but passes through the opponents instead, seemingly turning into a pale blue ghostly blade. Against creatures immune to subdual damage, it works like normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="description"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaern's Blade is a True Chaotic intelligent magic item, it does not speak, or act in any way by itself, lying dormant most of the time. The blade's refusal to kill and Magic absorbtion are a facet of its personality, as it was originally made to destroy wards and other magical defenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blade is a pale silver colour, with glowing sky blue symbols along the length.&lt;/p&gt;

Perfect for those pesky wizards! And great against creatures which eat magic as well, (as all magic is suppressed for a short period of time)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="summary"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;10ft radius sphere&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Takes up the &lt;strong&gt;Neck&lt;/strong&gt; slot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="anti-magic"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Anti-Magic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This acts like the spell &lt;strong&gt;Antimagic Field&lt;/strong&gt; and cannot be cast unless worn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="anti-kaern"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Anti-Kaern&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This necklace was made to fight against the Kaern, which eat magic, and spread a magical disease while doing so. Thus while allied abilities are suppressed under the field, no magic eating can occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Symbols on it pulse with a faint blood red light (rad 10' bright, rad 15' shadowy)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vampiric&lt;/strong&gt;: 1d4 Con Damage on hit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cursed Item&lt;/strong&gt;: You can't sheathe the blade without it drinking blood&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="description"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vampiric blade is made of adamantine (dark red color with a thin silvery hue), with glowing red symbols along the length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Saevon</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 10 Oct 2015 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag://blog.saevon.ca,2015-10-10:roleplaying/vampiric-blade/</guid><category>magic-item</category><category>D&amp;D</category></item><item><title>Ravaging Bow</title><link>//blog.saevon.ca/roleplaying/ravaging-bow/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magical Item:&lt;/strong&gt; An incomplete bow that multiplies every arrow it shoots. In its current broken state, it shoots 2 arrows aimed properly, and one that aims towards the user.
Don't underestimate its power! Though it targets the user as well, the bow can behead its opponents with ease, and enchants its arrows with any spell cast on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="summary"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;+3 Composite Longbow (1d8 Piercing, 125ft range, Vorpal)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;+4 Maximum Str bonus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spell Storing 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arrow Storm&lt;/strong&gt;: Shoots 3 arrows, cloning the arrow type you use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broken Item&lt;/strong&gt;: Shoots an arrow at yourself, and 2 at the enemy (roll 2d20)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aura&lt;/strong&gt;: Overwhelming Transmutation and Necromancy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="arrow-storm"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Arrow Storm&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This bow fires three arrows, any spell that the bow has stored is applied to the arrow, and the +3 enchantment bonus (if better than the arrow) is as well. But see the &lt;strong&gt;Broken Item&lt;/strong&gt; section below. Though the bow can be given to players as a complete, unbroken version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="alert alert-warning "&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-warning"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Optional&lt;/strong&gt;: The bow can technically be used to fire at someone with arrow catching, which wouldn't waste the arrow. If this happens, the DM can allow more spells to be added to the arrow each time its fired. Though this obviously can lead to abuse. As long as your players use it for crazy hijinks, this can be a great addition
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section4&amp;quot;" id="flavour-text"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Flavour Text&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ability spawns the two additional arrows beside the original as it leaves the bow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="broken-item"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Broken Item&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ravaging Bow is made to seek out enemies, attempting to behead them if possible. However when it clones one of the arrows in the wrong position (aimed towards the user). Thus when attacking roll 2d20, one for the arrow flying towards you, and one for the arrows flying towards the enemy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="alert alert-success "&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-check-circle"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
You can have someone standing by with gloves of arrow catching to prevent any problems with arrows flying towards you. Remember to let the players figure out these things themselves.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="legend"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Legend&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the story is but a small excerpt from a much larger tale, the highlights shall be retold here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="alert alert-info "&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-info-circle"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Craka&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Sai&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Galthor&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Aegis&lt;/strong&gt; were Player Characters in this scene. &lt;strong&gt;Thrisperios&lt;/strong&gt; was an NPC
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Craka&lt;/strong&gt;: a barbarian wielding an artifact of power (&lt;em&gt;Silvia&lt;/em&gt;), &lt;strong&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/strong&gt;: an arcane archer wielding the &lt;strong&gt;Ravaging Bow&lt;/strong&gt; and the rest of the party enter a dragon's layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fighting the dragon (&lt;strong&gt;Sai&lt;/strong&gt;) high above a perilous drop, on a huge overhang, with a glorious battle and wounds all around, the party was pushed back, and with &lt;strong&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/strong&gt; near death, &lt;strong&gt;Sai&lt;/strong&gt; throws her off the overhang! With &lt;strong&gt;Sai&lt;/strong&gt; following after her, under the overhang to avoid damage from the members above. &lt;strong&gt;Craka&lt;/strong&gt;, thinking fast jumps down after them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activiting Backlash Drain (syncing all damage and healing between him and &lt;strong&gt;Sai&lt;/strong&gt;, and doing extra damage to both of them). &lt;strong&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/strong&gt; takes one last shot, hoping to defeat &lt;strong&gt;Sai&lt;/strong&gt; before he finishes her off, and rolls&amp;hellip; 2 natural 20's! (after confirming the crit) With &lt;strong&gt;Craka&lt;/strong&gt;'s and &lt;strong&gt;Sai&lt;/strong&gt;'s health being synced together, a triple beheading occurs as the three of them crash into the ground below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="alert alert-success "&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-check-circle"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
While the rest of the party was not mentioned, that in no way implies their lack of awesomeness, just that they weren't really part of the beheaded trio (In this case &lt;strong&gt;Galthor&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Aegis&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Thrisperios&lt;/strong&gt; (An NPC which &lt;strong&gt;Craka&lt;/strong&gt;'s Player took over)
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="alert alert-info "&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-info-circle"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
The rest of the tale will be posted sometime under "Zai'Ren: The Chronicles of &lt;em&gt;Silvia&lt;/em&gt;"
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

With the threat beginning to reveal itself, the party does its best just to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section2&amp;quot;" id="cast"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cast&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jack&lt;/strong&gt; (Half-Nymph Hunter): Archer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zaire&lt;/strong&gt; (Human Ninja): Dark Rogue&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Played by &lt;strong&gt;SyC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Artix the Uncanny&lt;/strong&gt; (Gnome Inventor): Artificer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Played by &lt;strong&gt;Cr4ka&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section2&amp;quot;" id="story"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Gnomes of Aiventrix&lt;/strong&gt; are a peaceful race of inventors, a protectorate under &lt;strong&gt;Baron Ashon&lt;/strong&gt;. The gnomes refuse to craft anything for combat, and it is illegal to ever do so for any gnome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our story begins with &lt;strong&gt;Artix the Uncanny&lt;/strong&gt;, an inventor who got caught making his "Flaming Warhammer", yet another attempt to create easily reproducible magic items. With &lt;strong&gt;Artix&lt;/strong&gt; in prison, and forced to face other gnomes in their gladiatorial arena, he plots his escape. The &lt;strong&gt;Baron&lt;/strong&gt; saw this opportunity and sent &lt;strong&gt;Zaire&lt;/strong&gt;, who is being groomed to take over as resident spymaster, to get him out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Artix&lt;/strong&gt; prepared his escape carefully, hiding extra gear all around his laboratory as best he could. Barely keeping up against the other gnomish crafters who would make sure he had no way to escape, or gear secreted away. Though starting to give up hope, the message from the &lt;strong&gt;Baron&lt;/strong&gt; gave him hope, and a plan was laid out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet another battle &lt;strong&gt;Artix&lt;/strong&gt; fought, defeating his opponent in the arena once more. Yet with new protective measures (a taser) being snuck into his gear, he was caught of guard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zaire&lt;/strong&gt; snuck in, careful to leave an escape route for the two of them, but with &lt;strong&gt;Artix&lt;/strong&gt; still being dragged out of the arena, the time window was getting smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[DM: The rest is an excerpt from the journal of &lt;strong&gt;Jack&lt;/strong&gt;, with some notes added for clarity&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the unconscious gnome was dragged shamefully to his dirty urine covered cell, &lt;strong&gt;Zaire&lt;/strong&gt; picked the lock and dragged his unresponsive burden towards the exit he had previously mapped out. Noticing his useless companion is naked &lt;em&gt;[DM: not actually]&lt;/em&gt; and unequipped &lt;strong&gt;Zaire&lt;/strong&gt; decided to bring the gnome to a nearby workroom and dumped him face first into what looked like a bucket but could just as well been a bedpan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally awake &lt;strong&gt;Artix&lt;/strong&gt; quickly gathered up some equipment he thought was useful and the two of them headed towards the exit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon reaching the guard room, they noticed they had missed the guard change due to one of their tardiness and now faced with two armed gnomish guards. They rushed in and were able to subdue the guards but in the process &lt;strong&gt;Zaire&lt;/strong&gt; was shocked to unconsciousness by the protective armor the gnome guard was wearing. In a panic &lt;strong&gt;Artix&lt;/strong&gt; rushed out the prison dragging his companion only to find himself cut off by a cliff. Realizing he could not scale the cliff carrying such a heavy load, he decided to tell his friend to lose some weight in the future and also to search for some mean of waking him up. Luckily he found some potions of light heal in the pockets of the guards he defeated (among other things) and was able to revive his friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two of them quickly climbed down the cliff and meet up with &lt;strong&gt;Zaire’s&lt;/strong&gt; hireling. With the help of his hirelings the two quickly made it to an abandoned hideout &lt;strong&gt;Zaire&lt;/strong&gt; previously prepared [After a long boat ride to the local coast the group needed to lay low for three days before the gnomish searchers would widen their net, allowing them to slip by through the mountain pass].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However their movements were noticed by a local “human” hunter by the name of &lt;strong&gt;Jack&lt;/strong&gt;, who followed them into the cave out of “curiosity”. Upon entering the cave, the two noticed that the walls of the cave were splattered with blood, and they found bed rolls with dead bodies (with their hands chopped off) scattered near a dying fire. [Another body was lying in the middle of writing a dying message in a small alcove]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spying on the two, &lt;strong&gt;Jack&lt;/strong&gt; ventured into the cave as well, unknowingly he was attacked by a sneaky zombie that no one else in the world could have ever noticed. Fully calm and not panicking at all, he fired an arrow which hit the zombie square in the head and knocking it away. However this action revealed him to the two already scared shitless in the cave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They exchanged greetings and decided to figure out what is going on together. Being the bravest out of the three, &lt;strong&gt;Jack&lt;/strong&gt; decided to check the body in the bed roll. He was able to find a large sum of gold which he pocketed without the SLIGHTEST SUSPICION OR NOTICE FROM THE OTHER TWO &lt;em&gt;[DM: he was totally noticed]&lt;/em&gt;. [With &lt;strong&gt;Artix&lt;/strong&gt; noticing that the body was wearing typical necromancer gear, a follower of Nerghul]. &lt;strong&gt;Zaire&lt;/strong&gt; uncovered a dagger from one of the bodies lying on the wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a bit of searching, the three noticed a looming shadow from the way they came. A large spider like creature was feeding on the zombie &lt;strong&gt;Jack&lt;/strong&gt; had previously slain. With much valor &lt;strong&gt;Jack&lt;/strong&gt; let loose an arrow towards the monster, but the creature was nimble and possibly with the aid of some black magic was able to avoid the otherwise unavoidable arrow. Now enraged, the creature charged towards the party, but was slowed down by the narrowness of the cave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The party quickly got on their feet and started to sprint the other way. &lt;strong&gt;Zaire&lt;/strong&gt; was able to dive into a nearby cave river and hid underwater (but there was zombies in the water so he couldn’t stay long) &lt;em&gt;[DM: an enclosure with a set of chain fences holding the zombies at bay, so they could be reused by the necromancer]&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Jack&lt;/strong&gt; the fastest of the three got away safely, while the misshapen gnome was not so fortunate, the creature made short work of his feeble prey and trapped him with spiderweb. The (yet again) unconscious gnome was dragged and dumped into a pile of dead bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other two were able to hide from the monster, after a while they circled back and looked to regroup. &lt;strong&gt;Zaire&lt;/strong&gt; noticed that &lt;strong&gt;Artix’s&lt;/strong&gt; bag was lost to the rushing water of the river and could not be retrieved &lt;em&gt;[DM: he means the party didn't want to risk it]&lt;/em&gt;. After a bit of searching the three had regrouped and freed the almost crippled gnome from his bondage. The three then made a distraction and rushed out of the cave with a secret exit which &lt;strong&gt;Zaire&lt;/strong&gt; had prior knowledge to. Finally safe the three found themselves in a storage room. [&lt;strong&gt;Artix&lt;/strong&gt; pried open a barrel revealing a set of scrolls, which &lt;strong&gt;Zaire&lt;/strong&gt; packed away with him]. Stocked up on all the necessary supplies, the party got on a boat and headed down the river.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Great Emperor, The Great Red Wyrm, found that one of his villages was a wealth of mithril, ordering 200 pounds to be brought in as the initial shipment. Sending a trustworthy team of Kobolds to ensure everything would go as planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to problems along the highway, Groll was left behind to "&lt;em&gt;clean up&lt;/em&gt;", with the rest of the band moving on to the village. The four of them arrived, and were assured the mithril would be brought in by the next day, as promised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="excerpt-from-x"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Excerpt from X&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[DM: Excerpt from the journal of X]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our four brave heroes have settled at an in waiting for our shipment of mithril to be prepared. The Great Emperor, the Red Dragon will be pleased with the offering. Thinking so, our heroes let their guards down and retire for the night when&amp;hellip; BOOM~~~! Everything exploded. There were fires everywhere. Our heroes work hard to gather and make it to the mayor to find the THE MITHRIL HAD BEEN STOLEN ) O o O (. What will they do now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furious (not really) they charged off towards the mines. Moving through various traps, almost dieing to various shades of pink liquids, and defeating various sizes of goblins. Finally they made it to the EEEE~VIL necromancer and beat the crap out of him too. Thus saving the day and putting an end to the disease plaguing the citizens (which we failed to mention). The heroes march off with their rewards?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="excerpt-from-daniels"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Excerpt from Daniels&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woke up in a caved-in, burning inn. X got caught under a collapsed roof. Everyone eventually awoke and got out by climbing the rubble remains of the side of the inn. Met the mayor, he believes the goblins must have attacked the humans when they found out that humans have been mining mithil out of their caves (also ancient dwarven ruins). Party went to check out the mithril they were supposed to give as tribute but it was gone via implosion teleport magic. Mayor then begged the party to figure out the cause of the plague going around in the town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the mines the party took forever to enter the corridor due to arrow slits in the walls. Nothing happened. Inside the party tripped the noise trap in one room and opened a flooded room which was full of pinkish water. Which “seemed” to be just like normal water. Party managed to close the flooded room doors before much damage was done. Down the stairs the party found a submerged room with a magic hammer and some ruby eyed statues. X sunk down to the room using the full plate and then was brought back with a rope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next corridor was booby trapped with barrels full of shit. Some kobolds got hit, and the magic hammer was also covered by this substance. In the next room the party decimated a small army of hobgoblins and blew up an ogre, and to top it all off: flooded the room. Eventually the party reached the main caverns where they caught up with Groll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the hobgoblins from the previous room had his brains eaten and as a result was essentially a vegetable. The party used his remains to test a slightly more Pinkish fluid that pooled up at the end of the caverns. The mining caverns proved to be nearly fatal for Groll when he decided to go swimming in the pink liquid. The party found piles of dead hobgoblins and eventually found a room with huge columns of liquid mithral. On the bottom of this room there were swarms of fire ants which were quickly taken out by the molten mithral. The next room was a trap room with golden walls and false floors everywhere but the middle. This was a simple endeavor for all but X who nearly fell off right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final room contained an Orc cleric with seemed to control a blob of floating purple water. Which was later determined to be the source of the contaminated water in the nearby town. The Orc almost succeeded a party wipe, but was quickly dispatched due to his own sickness. The party found an empty crypt with a missing necklace in the middle of the room. Which was believed to belong to the former resident lich.&lt;/p&gt;

It doubles as a torture device due to its method of extracting them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="summary"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attacks creatures within &lt;strong&gt;30 feet&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1/rnd&lt;/strong&gt; do a &lt;strong&gt;Ref 20&lt;/strong&gt; or be forced to wear them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concentration 16&lt;/strong&gt; or launch an eye every &lt;strong&gt;10rnds&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When shapeshifting with eyes, you get its abilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Takes up the &lt;strong&gt;Headband&lt;/strong&gt; slot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cursed Item&lt;/strong&gt;: Can't be taken off&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="extraction"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Extraction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any creature wearing these goggles will see red marks appearing over everything they focus on. The more they focus on something the brighter the mark on it. The less they focus, the darker (or non-existent) the mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a creature focuses on something for too long they feel some pressure build up behind their eyes, until, the eye is popped out of its socket, and launched towards the targeted mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an eye is launched, a hard protective case is build up around it in the shape of a cylindrical glass container, a &lt;em&gt;Stasis Glass&lt;/em&gt;. The eye is held in a stasis field which prevents any damage unless the container itself is opened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="how-its-used"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How it's Used&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goggles are attracted to any creature with eyes that is within 1 size category of its size. When within &lt;strong&gt;30 feet&lt;/strong&gt; of such a creature they fly at their eyes, attaching themselves. The target gets a &lt;strong&gt;Reflex Save (DC: 20)&lt;/strong&gt; to block, though the goggles will keep trying &lt;strong&gt;1/rnd&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Every 10rnds&lt;/strong&gt; hereafter the target will need to do a &lt;strong&gt;concentration check (DC: 16)&lt;/strong&gt; to not focus too much (and launch 1 eye).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goggles are considered a &lt;strong&gt;Headband&lt;/strong&gt; magical item, thus preventing you from using any goggles, eye glasses or other such items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goggles are considered a cursed item for the sake of getting them off, thus &lt;strong&gt;Remove Curse&lt;/strong&gt; will make them fall off, after which they will take &lt;strong&gt;1d10&lt;/strong&gt; rnds to recover (launching one of their eyes on failure).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goggles are usually encountered as a stranded item, acting like a trap. However in reality these Goggles are used to collect Mystic Eyes, thus there is a way to control them. The Goggles are created with a small container to hold them. The container has an arcane symbol to press when you need to stop the goggles from attacking things, and another to get them to start up again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="&amp;quot;section section3&amp;quot;" id="stasis-glass"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Stasis Glass&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any eye in a Stasis Glass can't get any damage until the container breaks. This makes it the best way to store eyes until you have a need for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to a quirk in its production any shapeshifting while holding an eye grants the user that eye. This takes up the &lt;strong&gt;Headband&lt;/strong&gt; slot, preventing any other magic items from functioning. You can have as many eye changes as is available to your current form, thought this is mandatory. Using this you can change eye colour, shape and other such details. If you hold more eyes than your form has, you get to choose which ones work (or roll for randomness).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hardness:&lt;/strong&gt; 15&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HP:&lt;/strong&gt; 20&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aura:&lt;/strong&gt; Strong Transmutation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Stasis glass is broken, it disappears, but the contents fall out (and are probably ruined)&lt;/p&gt;
